Make sure probe is centered over mitral valve (In right spot if you can see MV and AV) E Point Septal Separation (EPSS) - Distance separating the anterior MV leaflet from the septal wall as measure of LV systolic function (easy evaluation of systolic function) - Place M mode spike at tip of mitral leaflet and hit M mode (perpendicular to septum) - Identify E point (passive filling of LV) and determine distance from interventricular septum (IVS) - <7mm = Normal - >10mm = HF - Confounders that elevate EPSS: AR, MS Parasternal short - Probe position: Rotate probe 180 degrees with right edge of probe/probe marker pointing toward pt's left shoulder - Good position to assess EF by visualizing wall thickening Apical four chamber - Probe position: Slide down and look near pt's left nipple (or in the intermammary fold after lifting up breast tissue if needed - at PMI if able to palpate) - Good to assess EF by visualizing cardiac shortening Subxiphoid - Probe position: Push probe head into pt's abdomen just below xiphoid and flatten probe to make nearly parallel to pt's position, marker to pt's left - Troubleshooting: shift probe slightly left of midline (toward pt's right) and angle toward heart/right to use liver as acoustic window or ask pt to take big breath (moves heart closer to probe) - Best window to visualize pericardial effusion IVC - Probe position: subxiphoid area with probe marker facing toward pt's head tilted slightly left of midline, trace IVC into RA to verify correct vessel (vs aorta) -

Predictor of mortality in CCU Blood Pressure Inpatient Hypertension Author: William Lavercombe Background Hypertensive urgency: SBP > 180 mmHg/DBP > 120 mmHg Hypertensive emergency: SBP > 180 mmHg/DBP > 120 mmHg + new or worsening target-organ damage Evaluation Are there signs/symptoms of end organ damage? - Neurologic symptoms: agitation, delirium, stupor, seizures, visual disturbances - Focal neurologic deficits - Chest pain - Back pain (consider aortic dissection) - Dyspnea (consider pulmonary edema) - Microvasculature manifestations: high grade-retinopathy, AKI, or microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia Management Hypertensive Urgency: Goal to gradually lower BP over 24-48 hrs, initial goal 160/110 Hypertensive Emergency Initial lowering should depend on the end organ damage observed: - Stroke: Initial: 130<SBP<180 mm Hg, MAP decline 15% in 1 hr - Hypertensive Encephalopathy: Immediate MAP decline of 20-25% in first hour - Cerebral Hemorrhage: Decrease SBP to 140-150 within 1 hr if SBP >150-220 - Preeclampsia, HELLP, Eclampsia: Immediate SBP <160 mm Hg and DBP <105 mmHg if severe - Hypertensive Retinopathy BP Target: SBP <180 mmHg, MAP decline of 15% - Acute Kidney Injury: MAP decline 20-25% over several hours - Acute Heart Failure: SBP <140 mmHg - Pulmonary Edema: Immediate SBP <140 mmHg - Acute Coronary Syndrome: SBP <140 mmHg - Exceptions to gradual lowering include: - Acute stroke: call code stroke, lower ONLY if BP > 185/110 in pts under consideration for reperfusion therapy; or BP > 220/120 in pts not candidates for reperfusion therapy - Aortic dissection: Goal = rapidly lower BP in minutes to target of 100-120 systolic to avoid aortic shearing forces; also want to lower heart rate as best as possible. Pharmacologic therapy: - Ensure their home medicines have been restarted at appropriate doses, formulation (long acting vs. short), and dosing intervals - If pt has a rapid acting anti-HTN med, can consider giving a dose early or an \"extra dose\" and then up titrating their overall daily dose - Rescue therapies: - Hydralazine PO (10-20mg initial dosing Q6H) - Isosorbide dinitrate PO (5-20mg TID) - Nifedipine XL PO (dose at 30mg initially, max 90mg BID; NOT sublingual) - Labetalol IV (10-40mg initially; dosed up to every 20-30mins) - Hydralazine IV (10-20mg initially; dosed up to every 30 mins). - Nitroglycerin Infusion - Nitropaste 1\" (can add/wipe away for titration; dose Q6H until oral meds can be started for better long-acting control) - Dialysis if missed session Additional Information Refractory HTN: try additional agents listed above vs. escalation of care for drip (nicardipine, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, esmolol). Consider secondary workup (urine metanephrines, renal vascular US, renin-aldosterone levels) Most drips that can be done for this indication are done in stepdown and usually require no-titration of the infusion and occasionally the MD to be bedside to initiate the infusion. This includes diltiazem, labetalol, nitroglycerin, and verapamil drips. Nicardipine, esmolol, and nitroprusside infusions (ggt) are not allowed on step down.

Management: BBs and non-DHP CCBs can be effective, address underlying issue AVNRT/AVRT Mechanism/etiologies: - AVNRT - reentrant loop that involves the AV node and the atrial tissue causing simultaneous depolarization of the atrium and the ventricle. - AVRT - Involves an accessory pathway that bypasses the normal insulation provided by the atrioventricular valves, allowing conduction between the atria and ventricles Characteristics: - AVNRT: P wave rarely seen (buried in QRS). - AVRT: in narrow complex (orthodromic), P after QRS; in wide complex (antidromic), P rarely observed (buried in T wave) Management: - Vagal maneuvers (1st line): Sit pt upright \u2192 have them blow into tip of 10cc syringe for 10-15 seconds \u2192 rapidly lay supine and raise legs - Adenosine (2nd line): therapeutic (break AVRT/AVNRT and 80% of atrial tachycardias) and diagnostic (allows visualization of underlying rhythm) - Would try and have continuous 12 lead EKG on while pushing adenosine to try and catch the underlying rhythm - Do NOT give in heart transplant, severe COPD, pre-excitation causing wide complex tachycardia (WPW \u2192 antidromic AVRT) - Peripheral at AC or above w/ arm elevated: 6mg x1 \u2192 6mg x1 (if not effective after 1-2 min) \u219212mg x1 (if refractory to 6mg) - Central: cut dose in half to 3mg x1 \u2192 3mg x1 \u2192 6mg Dosing Drug Dosing Benefits Side Effects Metoprolol 5mg IV q5m x3 PO metop tartrate 12.5mg q6h, \u2191 every 6h to target Good 1st line agent Less BP effect than dilt Hypotension, Negative inotropy Diltiazem 10-20mg IV over 2m q15m x2 drip = 5-15mg/h Good 1st line w/ normal EF with drip needed Hypotension Do NOT use in HFrEF Esmolol 500mcg/kg bolus drip = 50-200mcg/kg/min Rapid onset/offset RBC metabolism Hypotension Amiodarone 150mg IV over 10-30m, then 1mg/m for 6h, then 0.5mg/m for 18h Minimal BP effects Long lasting; Relatively fast onset (acute effect is mostly beta blockade) Pulmonary and thyroid toxicity Cardioversion Digoxin 500mcg IV x1, then 250mcg IV q6h x2-3 Great for reduced EF, positive inotropy Slow onset Depends on vagal tone \u2013 poor in hyper-adrenergic states Procainamide 20-50mg/min loading, 1-4mg/min maintenance Use in pre-excitation syndromes (i.e. WPW), does not inhibit AV nodal conduction Lupus-like syndrome Hypotension Tachyarrhythmias - Wide Complex and PVCs Author: Cesar Campos Definitions Premature Ventricular Complex (PVC): early ventricular depol +/- mechanical contraction PVCs are common: Up to 80% of apparently healthy people have PVCs PVC induced cardiomyopathy may be present with PVC burden >10-20% Inpt Eval: Order 12 lead EKG to look for conduction disease (Long QT, brugada), K, Mg, TSH, Drug screen (EtOH, nicotine, stimulants, caffeine), med rec for QT prolonging agents, tele to assess PVC burden Inpt management: consult to EP for PVCs rarely warranted unless significant PVC burden (>5 PVC/min, consistently) in setting of reduced LVEF. For pts with >5 PVC/min or pts with symptoms, discharge with Ziopatch (VA) or mobile cardiac telemetry (VU) and obtain TTE if not done in past 3 months. Ventricular tachycardia: a run of 3+ PVCs Sustained VT: VT for >30 seconds or shorter if it requires intervention Nonsustained VT (NSVT): VT for < 30 seconds VT storm: 3+ separate episodes of sustained VT within 24 hrs. VT Morphologies Monomorphic VT: similar QRS configuration from beat to beat Usually 2/2 scar-mediated VT from prior infarction Polymorphic VT: a continuously changing QRS configuration from beat to beat Ischemia until proven otherwise Torsades de Pointes: a form of polymorphic VT with a continually varying QRS that appears to spiral around the baseline of the ECG in a sinusoidal pattern Ventricular fibrillation (VF): chaotic rhythm characterized by undulations that are irregular in timing and morphology, without discrete QRS complexes Wide-complex tachycardia (WCT): QRS >0.12 seconds and HR >100 beats/min Wide-complex tachycardia evaluation WC-caused by ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) or supraventricular tachycardias with aberrant conduction resulting from one of the following: disease in the His\u2013Purkinje system, such as left or right bundle-branch block; a bypass tract (i.e., Wolff\u2013Parkinson\u2013White syndrome), with depolarization of the ventricle from the bypass tract; or a ventricular paced rhythm from a pacemaker. Of note, a bundle branch block may appear with faster or slower heart rates and disappear with normal heart rates (ie, rate dependent). To differentiate between WCTs: - Regular WCT: monomorphic VT or SVT with aberrant conduction - Look at baseline rhythm: If QRS morphology identical to those seen in sinus rhythm, likely SVT with aberrant conduction; if not, likely monomorphic VT - If AV dissociation present and ventricular rate faster than, atrial rate, then it is likely VT. - If an escape beat or fusion beat is seen, this would also support VT - If AV dissociation present and ventricular rate faster than atrial rate, likely VT - Positively or negatively concordant QRS complexes in precordial leads suggest VT. - Irregular WCT: atrial fibrillation with aberrant conduction (if same QRS morphologies) or polymorphic VT (if different QRS morphologies) Management Unstable: - Sedate with midazolam 1-2mg - Cardioversion for monomorphic VT. Synchronized shock at 100-200J - Defibrillation if VF/polymorphic VT Stable: Drug Name (Antiarrhythmic class) Dosing Side Effects Amiodarone (class III) 150mg IV over 10 min, then 1mg/min for 6 hours; repeat bolus if VT recurs Bradycardia, hypotension (acutely) Lidocaine (class IIB) 1-1.5mg/kg (usually 75-100mg) at a rate of 25-50mg/min; lower doses of .5-.75mg/kg can be repeated every 5-10min as needed Slurred speech, AMS, seizures, bradycardia Procainamide (class IA) 20-50mg/min until arrhythmia terminates or max dose 17mg/kg is reached Bradycardia, hypotension, torsades, drug-induced lupus Avoid in HF pts, prolonged QT Cardioversion if refractory to medical management Treatment of underlying cause if identifiable: Ischemia, electrolyte disturbances, heart failure, drugs Atrial Fibrillation and Flutter Author: Michael Daw Background AF: 12-lead EKG with absence of p-waves and irregularly irregular QRS complexes Flutter: sawtooth atrial F waves (300 BPM) with regular or regularly irregular QRS complexes Ventricular rate ratio of F waves: V waves ~150 (2:1), ~100 (3:1), or ~75 (4:1) 4 classifications: Paroxysmal (intermittent and terminates <7 days) Persistent (continuous >7 days) Longstanding persistent (continuous for >12 months) Permanent (normal rhythm cannot be restored or no further attempts to restore it) Rapid ventricular response (RVR) is HR > 100 (i.e. AF/Flutter w/ tachycardia) AF/RVR is far more often a consequence of hypotension than the cause of it. Evaluation Causes: Mnemonic \"H PIRATES\": - H ypertension - P neumonia - P ericarditis - P ost-op - I schemia (rare) - R heumatic Valve - A trial Myxoma or A ccessory Pathway - T hyrotoxicosis - E thanol, E lectrolytes, or E xcess Volume - S ick sinus, S epsis - Additional causes: Lung disease (COPD, asthma, smoking), OSA, obesity Management Treatment goals: - Rate control, Goal HR < 110 (RACE II) - Rhythm control (if indicated) - Stroke prevention (CHADS2VASc) Rate control: - RVR ~ sinus tach of AF; Always work to address the underlying cause (infection, volume overload, etc.). Rate control is rarely an emergency unless the pt is unstable - Unstable (SBP <80): Cardioversion - Stable (SBP >90): IV AV nodal blockers if HR > 130 or symptomatic (metop 5mg IV or dilt 15-20mg IV, every 15 minutes up to 3x), otherwise opt for PO B-blockers: Start with metop tartrate (titratable) \u2192 consolidate to succinate. Avoid in decompensated or borderline HF Calcium channel blockers (diltiazem): DO NOT give in HFrEF Peri stable (SBPs 80-90s w/ preserved perfusion): Amiodarone: Consider if decompensated HF, anti-coagulated. Caution that you may cardiovert pt (stroke risk) Digoxin: consider if decompensated HF, will require IV loading dose prior to transition to PO. Will need to monitor digoxin levels Avoid AV nodal blockers and amiodarone in AF with preexcitation (WPW) as these can trigger Vfib, consider procainamide in consultation with cardiology Rhythm Control: - Consider in new onset AF (first time diagnosis), symptomatic AF, younger patients, high cardiovascular risk, or heart failure not acutely decompensated (EAST-AFNET 4) - If onset clearly within 48h, can proceed without TEE. Often TEE is done anyway (pt may have had intermittent asymp AF) - If onset >48h or unclear, will need TEE to rule out LAA thrombus; you can also anti-coagulate for 3 weeks prior to TEE if unable to get TEE. - Pharmacologic options include class 1C: flecainide, propafenone (avoid in structural heart disease) and class 3: Amiodarone, dronedarone, sotalol, ibutilide, dofetilide (some require loading inpt) - Caution using antiarrhythmics in any pt you wouldn't cardiovert without TEE - Consider EP consult for ablation in symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF refractory to anti-arrhythmic drugs, AF in HFrEF, or flutter in outpt setting Stroke Prevention (for AF and flutter): - If cardioversion planned for new onset AF, start AC as soon as possible - Post-cardioversion, must be on anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks d/t atrial stunning and stroke risk - CHA2DS2-VASc risk score >2 in M or >3 in F should prompt long term AC in AF persisting >48 hours, even after successful rhythm control - DOACs (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban) are preferred to warfarin except in moderate to severe MS or mechanical valve - For apixaban, consider reduced dose 2.5 mg BID if age >80, body weight <60 kg, or serum Cr >1.5 mg/dL - Typically, do not need to bridge AC for AF in the setting of procedures unless mechanical valve is present. Decide on a case by-case basis - Left atrial appendage closure (WATCHMAN, Amulet) can be considered in those with increased risk of bleeding, but post-operative oral AC plus aspirin is typically required for 45 days, followed by DAPT for 6 months. Heart Failure Author: Matthew Alonso Background ACC/AHA Stages of HF Stage A: At risk but without structural heart disease, symptoms, or cardiac biomarkers Stage B: no symptoms/signs of HF; presence of structural heart disease, incr filling pressures, or incr cardiac biomarkers Stage C: + structural HD, + prior or current symptoms Stage D: end stage/refractory HF, symptoms interfered with daily life and recurrent hospitalizations NY Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classes of HF Class I: Ordinary physical activity does not cause symptoms of HF. No limitation of physical activity. Class II: Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but ordinary physical activity results in symptoms of HF. Class III: Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but less than ordinary activity causes symptoms of HF (such as walking short distances). Class IV: Unable to perform any physical activity without symptoms of HF, or symptoms of HF at rest.

Cardiogenic Shock Author: Matthew Alonso Definition Impairment of CO due to primary cardiac disorder that results in end-organ hypoperfusion and hypoxia Mortality up to 40-50% Etiology Cardiomyopathic: acute myocardial infarction with LV dysfunction (most common cause), exacerbation of heart failure, PHTN exacerbation, myocarditis, myocardial contusion, drug-induced Arrhythmogenic: atrial tachycardias (atrial fibrillation/flutter, AVRT, AVNRT), VT/VF, complete heart block, 2nd degree heart block Mechanical: valvular insufficiency, valvular rupture, papillary muscle rupture, critical valvular stenosis, ventricular septal wall defect, ruptured ventricular wall aneurysm, atrial myxoma, HOCM Presentation and diagnostic criteria Signs of end-organ hypoperfusion - AMS, cold and clammy skin, decreased UOP (<30cc/hr), and elevated lactate (>2). SBP < 90 mmHg for >30min or needing vasopressors to achieve this goal Drop in MAP >30mmHg below baseline or MAP <60mmHg Cardiac index <1.8L/min/m\u00b2 without hemodynamic support or <2.2L/min/m\u00b2 with support PCWP >15mmHg SCAI Classification Stage A: At Risk \u2013 Normotensive with normal perfusion Stage B: Beginning (Pre-shock) - Hypotension without hypoperfusion. CI >2.2 Stage C: Classic Cardiogenic Shock \u2013 Hypotension and hypoperfusion. Clinical signs cold, clammy skin, altered mentation, and decreased urine output, elevated lactate. CI <2.2, PCWP >15 Stage D: Deteriorating \u2013 Worsening hemodynamics despite initial interventions, requiring escalating use of pressors or MCS to maintain SBP and end-organ perfusion. Stage E: Extremis \u2013 Refractory hypotension and hypoperfusion requiring multiple simultaneous acute interventions, often experiencing cardiac arrest requiring CPR and/or ECMO. Evaluation EKG, CBC, CMP, BNP, troponin, lactate Echocardiogram: assess EF and valves LHC if ischemic (see ACS) Hemodynamic monitoring via Swan-Ganz or PA catheter: No benefit for general shock but does improve in-hospital mortality for those with cardiogenic shock PA catheter hemodynamic profile: Cardiac index < 2.2 with support or <1.8 without support, cardiac power <0.6, SVR >1200 initially, then may drop <800 as systemic inflammation causes vasodilation, SVO2 (mixed venous O2 sat) <60%, RVEDP >10 LV-dominant: PCWP >RA (CVP), PAPi >1.5 (pulmonary artery pulsatility index = (Pulmonary Artery Systolic Pressure - Pulmonary Artery Diastolic Pressure) / Right Atrial Pressure) RV-dominant: RA >15, PCWP <15, PAPi <1.5 Bi-V-dominant: RA >15, PCWP >15, PAPi <1.5 PAPi < 0.9 predicts RV failure and that pt will likely need RV support. PAPi <1.85 predicts RV failure in pts with LVADs CPO < 0.6 strongest independent hemodynamic correlate of mortality in CS See right heart cath section for interpreting PA catheter profiles While on CCU rotation, CCU swan sheet provided by Chiefs prior to start. Equation is built into the spreadsheet, although you will need to make sure to input patient specific height and weight metrics in top right corner of sheet. On CCU, update swan sheet Q4H for patients with active Swan-Ganz or PA catheters. Utilize hemodynamics/filling pressures that correlate with timing of draw of MVO2 as this is the value that was zeroed by nursing staff. Thermodilution: uses temperature gradient between two points along PA catheter. Clinical conditions that compromise accuracy of thermodilution measurements due to underestimation or overestimation of cardiac output: valvular regurgitation, intracardiac shunts, and very low flow states Management (medical & mechanical circulatory support) Medical management: focus on optimizing preload, afterload, and contractility - Preload: IV diuresis \u2013 hypotension IMPROVES with diuresis in cardiogenic shock - Afterload: IV \u2013 nitroglycerine, nitroprusside; PO \u2013 captopril, hydralazine, isosorbide dinitrate; vasoconstricting pressors (norepinephrine, vasopressin, phenylephrine) if needing BP support - Contractility - Inodilators (increase contractility, decrease afterload \u2013 milrinone, dobutamine) or inoconstrictors (increase contractility and afterload \u2013 epinephrine, norepinephrine) Mechanical circulatory support indications: - Shock refractory to >1 pressor - Shock 2/2 MI (physiology: unloads LV, increases systemic perfusion, increases myocardial perfusion, and provides hemodynamic support during PCI) Types of mechanical circulatory support (MCS): Intra-aortic Balloon Pump V-A ECMO Tandem Heart Impella Mechanics of Support Balloon pump placed in the proximal aorta that inflates during diastole (increasing coronary perfusion) and deflates during systole (LV afterload reduction) Blood from femoral vein is oxygenated and pumped to femoral artery LV: blood aspirated from LA to femoral artery RV: blood aspirated from RA to PA Impella 5.5 & CP: Blood aspirated from LV and ejected to aortic root Impella RP: Blood aspirated from IVC and delivered to PA Flow 0.5-1 L/min 4-6 L/min 4-5 L/min 2.5-5 L/min Support LV BiV LV, RV, or BiV LV or RV (RP) Hemodynamics Reduces afterload and LVEDP \u2192 decr cardiac work, O2 consumption Increases SV Increases coronary perfusion Increases afterload Reduces SV Reduces LV preload and PCWP Improves tissue perfusion Increases afterload Reduces SV Reduces LV preload and PCWP Improves tissue perfusion Reduces SV Reduces preload and PCWP Improves tissue perfusion Complications Infection, stroke, thrombocytopenia, balloon malpositioning leading to ischemia, aortic rupture, air embolism Circuit thrombosis, LV dilation.

Inflation should occur at the onset of diastole (middle of the T-wave on ECG) and deflation at the onset of systole (peak of the R-wave on ECG). Cardiac Devices Author: Daniela Gomez Zubieta 1. Pacemakers A device that maintains or restores a normal heart rhythm by stimulating the myocardium. Peripheral permanent pacemakers (PPMs) - SubQ generator, transvenous leads - Single chamber: RV (most common) or RA lead - Dual chamber: RV and RA leads - BiV (CRT- cardiac resynchronization therapy): RV, RA, and LV (coronary sinus) leads Leadless pacemaker (Micra) - Implanted generator in RV Indication: (class 1 indications below, refer to ACC/AHA guidelines for class 2 and 3) - Sinus node dysfunction (sinoatrial exit block, sinus pause, sinus bradycardia, tachy-brady syndrome) - AV block (Mobitz II, 3rd degree, 2nd degree of any kind w/ symptomatic bradycardia, chronic bifasicular block - Persistent symptomatic 2nd or 3rd degree block after acute MI - Neurocardiogenic syncope 2. Implantable Cardioverter/Defibrillators (ICDs): Transvenous: defibrillation coil +/- pacing lead - Detect and treat VT/VF - Anti-tachycardic pacing (ATP)- attempts to pace out of VT to prevent a shock - Defibrillation if ATP unsuccessful Subcutaneous: defibrillation only, all extravascular Indications: Primary prevention: - HFrEF - EF <35% and NYHA II-III or EF <30% and NYHA I - Must be >90d from revasc, >40d from MI, and on GDMT >90d if non-ischemic - Arrhythmogenic syndromes - Arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy, Brugada syndrome, HCM and cardiac sarcoid with specific risk factors Secondary prevention: - Sudden cardiac death - Sustained VT/VF (spontaneous sustained, cardiac arrest 2/2 VT/VF) - Inducible VT on EP study with history of syncope 3. Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) BiV pacer that coordinates LV/RV contraction through synchronized activation of each ventricle following atrial contraction. P: CRT pacing only D: ICD function 4. LVADs Augment cardiac output for end-stage heart failure Examples of Common Pacing Modes on PPM: VVI: Single RV lead that delivers a beat if no beat sensed. Often used with chronic AF with bradycardia DDDR: Senses and paces both the atria and ventricle. If beat not sensed within a predefined interval, beat delivered. R indicates rate responsivity (changes rate based on changes in pt activity) Magnet: Paces at a fixed rate without respect to native electrical activity (AOO,VOO,DOO). Deactivates ICD shock. Often used in surgery or at end of life to avoid ICD shocks Peri-Procedural Anticoagulation: NOAC: hold 24-72h before procedure and 24-72h following procedure Warfarin: continue through procedure Antiplatelet: continue through procedure Heparin and heparin related products to be avoided peri-implantation due to higher rates of pocket hematoma Placement Complications Pocket hematoma Pneumothorax Myocardial Perforation Lead Displacement Lead Disconnection Cardiac Tamponade Infection Long term Complications Secondary device Infection Lead fracture (lead lifetime 10-15 years) Insulation failure The Pacemaker ID app is free and is useful for identifying device brand for interrogation When differentiating PPM vs. ICD, look for a coil and charge generator to identify the ICD. Pulmonary Embolism Author: Matthew Alonso Background A thrombus originating in a deep vein (LE > UE) embolizing to the pulmonary arterial circulation Risk Factors = Virchow's Triad: Stasis: immobilization, hospitalization, spinal cord injury, or long travel Hypercoagulable state: cancer, prothrombotic genetic conditions, OCPs, nephrotic syndrome, peri-partum, infection, autoimmune disease, etc. Endothelial Injury: surgery, trauma, CVC, recent major infection/sepsis Most originate from a DVT in the iliac, femoral, and popliteal veins Presentation Dyspnea and tachypnea Respiratory alkalosis on blood gas from hyperventilation Hypoxemia Sinus tachycardia or atrial arrhythmias Hypotension Hemoptysis Lower extremity pain, swelling, and redness \u2013 occurs in 50% of pts with DVT RV Failure (large PE) \u2013 elevated JVP, hypotension, syncope, R parasternal heave, accentuated P2, hepatomegaly Other: S3/S4, pleural friction rub, decreased breath sounds, wheezing, fever Evaluation If hemodynamically unstable and PE suspected, provide hemodynamic support (ie.

Decide on a case by-case basis - Left atrial appendage closure (WATCHMAN, Amulet) can be considered in those with increased risk of bleeding, but post-operative oral AC plus aspirin is typically required for 45 days, followed by DAPT for 6 months.","title":"Management"},{"location":"Cardiology/#heart-failure","text":"Author: Matthew Alonso","title":"Heart Failure"},{"location":"Cardiology/#background_7","text":"","title":"Background"},{"location":"Cardiology/#accaha-stages-of-hf","text":"Stage A: At risk but without structural heart disease, symptoms, or cardiac biomarkers Stage B: no symptoms/signs of HF; presence of structural heart disease, incr filling pressures, or incr cardiac biomarkers Stage C: + structural HD, + prior or current symptoms Stage D: end stage/refractory HF, symptoms interfered with daily life and recurrent hospitalizations","title":"ACC/AHA Stages of HF"},{"location":"Cardiology/#ny-heart-association-nyha-functional-classes-of-hf","text":"Class I: Ordinary physical activity does not cause symptoms of HF.

Often, but not always, with associated tachycardia pending underlying etiology Clinical signs of tissue hypoperfusion: Neurologic: AMS, decreased mentation with possible obtundation, disorientation or confusion Cutaneous: Cool extremities, clammy skin w/peripheral vasoconstriction and cyanosis, and poor cap refill (note: distributive shock often has warm extremities with some signs of vasodilation) Renal: Urine output <30 mL/h or of <0.5ml/kg of body weight/hr Hyperlactatemia (which indicates abnormal cellular oxygen metabolism) and other markers of organ dysfunction such as impaired renal function (AKI), elevated liver function tests (shock liver), and metabolic acidosis Management of Shock Author: Brian Haimerl Cardiogenic Shock Background: Pathophysiology: Primary insult (see etiologies) -> CO/CI decreased -> systemic hypoperfusion -> compensatory mechanisms including increased SVR and fluid retention -> further reduction of CO PA catheter findings: Typically, high PCWP >15mmHg (can be low/normal in right heart failure), low CO (CI <2.8 L/min/m\u00b2), high SVR (>1400 dynes/sec/cm\u2075) and SvO2 <65% Etiologies: Acute MI, cardiomyopathy (LHF, RHF or biventricular), arrhythmia, mechanical such as acute AR (ex: dissection) or MR (ex: ruptured papillary muscle), myocarditis, blunt cardiac trauma Presentation: \"Cold and wet\" - cold and clammy skin/limbs, weak/nonpalpable distal pulses, edematous, elevated JVP; narrow pulse pressure; hypoxia w/crackles and pulmonary edema on CXR; POCUS with plump, non-collapsable IVC, reduced EF, and B-lines Patients can be normotensive and still in cardiogenic shock w/ end-organ hypoperfusion Management See \"cardiogenic shock\" in the Cardiology section Distributive Shock Background: Pathophysiology: Severe, peripheral vasodilation CO/CI increased, SVR decreased, PCWP and RAP normal to low, SvO2 >65% Etiologies: Sepsis (most common), anaphylaxis, neurogenic, adrenal insufficiency, pancreatitis Signs/symptoms: Sepsis: Localizing signs of infection; tachycardia, tachypnea, may be hypo/hyperthermic; POCUS with hyperdynamic cardiac function Anaphylaxis: History of anaphylaxis; urticaria, edema, diarrhea, wheezing on exam Neurogenic: History of CNS trauma; focal neurologic deficits on exam, associated bradycardia Adrenal insufficiency: History of chronic steroid use, may have GI symptoms, hyponatremia (common), hyperkalemia (rare), hypoglycemia, hypo/hyperthermia, NAGMA Pancreatitis: Abdominal pain with radiation to back, elevated lipase, evidence on CT scan Management: Sepsis: See \"Sepsis\" in Infectious Disease Anaphylaxis: 0.3mg IM epinephrine (0.01mg/kg, max 0.5mg) ASAP to be repeated q5-15min x 3; IVF boluses for supportive treatment; after third IM epi, consider epi gtt (1-10 mcg/min) if persistent hypotension. Adjuncts: Albuterol nebs for bronchospasm, H1 and H2 blockers, glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone 1mg/kg). EPINEPHRINE SAVES LIVES. Neurogenic: Caution with IVF resuscitation, can worsen cerebral and spinal cord edema; preferred pressor is norepinephrine; for neurogenic shock 2/2 spinal cord pathology, consider higher MAP goal 85-90 mmHg for 7 days to improve spinal cord perfusion Adrenal insufficiency: Stress dose steroids with hydrocortisone \u2013 initial dose of 100mg IV followed by 50mg q6h. IVF resuscitation. NOTE: Adrenal crisis NEVER comes out of nowhere; look for precipitating factor (missed medication, infection, trauma, surgery, or stressors) Pancreatitis: IVF + pressors; trend H/H, BUN, and Ca; treat complications (necrotizing pancreatitis, abdominal compartment syndrome); address underlying etiology (see \"Acute Pancreatitis\" in GI section) Hypovolemic Shock Background Etiologies: Hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic Signs/symptoms: Hemorrhagic: Common sources include GI, retroperitoneal (*needs high index of suspicion), traumatic, intraabdominal, thighs, thorax. Non-hemorrhagic: 2/2 GI losses or decreased PO intake POCUS with thin, collapsible IVC Management (Hemorrhagic) Ensure good access with two large-bore (at least 18G) IVs ideally in AC or above; Cordis or MAC CVC (can also use dialysis catheter, if necessary) Hyperacute bleed: 1:1:1 ratio FFP:Plt:RBC (balanced resuscitation), trauma blood (fastest way to get RBCs); massive transfusion protocol (MTP) Monitor iCa and replete (citrated blood products will deplete Ca) Minimize crystalloid if possible, w/primary use to prevent immediate hemodynamic collapse (contributes to coagulopathy, hypothermia, acidemia, trauma/surgery) Permissive hypotension until source control/transfusions with arterial bleeds (high MAP/SBP -> clot destabilization); trend POC lactate/exam to guide Acute traumatic arterial bleed or post-partum hemorrhage consider TXA (1-2g bolus) Reverse anticoagulation, if applicable Vasopressors -> generally poorly effective, would start with norepinephrine Source control -> GI, IR, or EGS Variceal bleed: See GI Bleeding section for specific management Management (Non-Hemorrhagic) Aggressive IVF resuscitation (balanced crystalloid); target MAP \u226565 Can support BP during resuscitation with pressors (usually norepinephrine) Obstructive Shock See dedicated section below Obstructive Shock Author: Hannah Kieffer Background Obstructive shock occurs when there is increased resistance to forward blood flow. This can occur due to: Resistance in the pulmonary/cardiovascular circuit (i.e., pulmonary embolism, intracardiac mass) Extrinsic compression on the heart and decreased diastolic filling (i.e., pericardial tamponade, tension pneumothorax, dynamic hyperinflation (auto-PEEP)) Risk factors vary based on the underlying pathology: PE: Known DVT, prothrombotic conditions, malignancy, recent orthopedic surgery or prolonged travel; family history of clots/thrombophilia Pneumothorax: Recent chest trauma/thoracic procedures, mechanical ventilation, COPD/emphysema, endobronchial valve placement Tamponade: Recent cardiac procedure, ESRD, cancer, trauma, rheumatologic diseases Approach in the Hemodynamically Unstable Patient Initial workup: Evaluate the patient at bedside and bring an ultrasound if available to perform POCUS Orders: STAT CBC, CMP, EKG, BNP, troponin, VBG, lactate, d-dimer, CXR Supportive measures: Consider fluid administration, especially if concerned that patient is preload dependent (e.g. cardiac tamponade) Perform passive leg test (compare cardiac output/blood pressure between patient lying at 45 degrees and patient to lying back with both legs raised) or trial small fluid bolus to test for fluid responsiveness Try to avoid vasopressors since increasing afterload could aggravate obstructive shock. However, if vital, can consider norepinephrine vs vasopressin to maintain lowest necessary MAP (both thought to have lesser effect on pulmonary vasculature) If ventilated, aim for low volume and low PEEP settings to minimize afterload on the right ventricle Clinical Signs/Symptoms: General: Hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxemia, elevated JVP, cold extremities Tension pneumothorax: Unilateral breath sounds, asymmetrical chest rise, CXR with one lung collapsed, tracheal deviation/mediastinal shift away from the pneumothorax Pulmonary embolism: Chest pain, hypoxia, sense of impending doom. On EKG: Most common is sinus tachycardia but look for right heart strain (right axis deviation, S1Q3T3, ST depressions in inferior leads/precordial leads, new RBBB) Cardiac tamponade: Beck's Triad (distant heart sounds, JVD, and hypotension), electrical alternans, low amplitude on EKG, pulsus paradoxus (drop in systolic blood pressure by >10 mmHg during inspiration) POCUS findings: PE: Distended IVC, RV dilation, McConnell's sign, Septal D sign, underfilled LV Pneumothorax: Lack of lung sliding Cardiac tamponade: Diastolic collapse of the RV, large pericardial effusion Further Evaluation and Management by most common etiologies: Pulmonary Embolism Evaluation: STAT CTA PE Management: - Supportive measures: vasopressors, supplemental O2 - Start high-dose therapeutic heparin gtt if high suspicion even before clot has been identified/confirmed, with heparin bolus unless contraindicated (i.e., recent GI bleed) - NOTE: First line is LMWH due to faster onset of action and longer time in therapeutic range. At VUMC, we often start heparin gtt first because if pt is going for EKOS, they need to be able to turn off AC quickly. We recommend starting heparin gtt until decision for EKOS has been made. If no EKOS, switch to LMWH - If massive PE, activate PERT (PE Response Team) for discussion regarding mechanical thrombectomy or chemical thrombolysis - Call \"1-1111\" and state \"that your pt has a massive PE\"/\"activate PERT\" - Look for the source for the embolism (four extremity dopplers) - If no risk factors for VTE are identified, consider a benign hematology outpatient referral for a hypercoagulable work-up - See \"Pulmonary Embolism\" in Cardiology section for more information Cardiac tamponade: Evaluation: Cardiac POCUS, follow up with formal echo Management: - Supportive measures: Support preload; IV fluid bolus to temporarily improve cardiac output. AVOID diuretics, venodilators, and proning - If un-stable, STAT consult cardiothoracic surgery for procedural management (pericardiocentesis vs drain) - If stable, consult cardiology and/or cardiothoracic surgery Tension pneumothorax: Evaluation: Chest POCUS (look for lack of lung sliding), STAT CXR Management: - If acutely unstable: Emergent needle decompression - 14-16 gauge needle (7-8cm long) in 5th intercostal space at the mid-axillary line (5th ICS-MAL) vs 2nd intercostal space mid-clavicular line (2nd ICS-MCL) - ATLS guidelines recommend 5th ICS-MAL since some studies suggest improved success rate and lower risk of complications (hitting major vessel) but data is not definitive - Can consider 2nd ICS-MCL when left sided if small body habitus and c/f cardiac puncture - Otherwise, urgent chest tube placement with pulmonology (if at the VA overnight, ED attending can place one) - Once stabilized, consult to pulmonology for chest tube placement is indicated in large, hemodynamically significant pneumothorax to ensure resolution. - For more on chest tubes, see \"Chest Tubes\" in Pulmonary Sepsis Authors: Jacob Lee, Jessica Reed Definitions (Sepsis 3): Sepsis: Organ dysfunction (change in total SOFA score \u2265 2 points) from dysregulated host response to infection Septic shock: Sepsis + vasopressor requirement to maintain MAP \u2265 65 mmHg + serum lactate > 2 mEq/dL despite adequate volume resuscitation Evaluation: Early screening for/identification of infection Screening: preferably incorporate multiple - SIRS, NEWS, MEWS superior to qSOFA as single-agent-screening tools (more sensitive) - SIRS: - RR >20/min - T <36\u00b0C or > 38\u00b0C - HR >90 bpm - WBC <4 or >12x10\u2079/L or >10% bands - SOFA (less sensitive, more specific): PaO2/FiO2, Thrombocytopenia, Hyperbilirubinemia, Hypotension, AMS, Kidney Injury, UOP.

Overnight, can order one dose but will need ID approval for following doses Anaerobic coverage: Metronidazole/Piperacillin-tazobactam/Ampicillin-sulbactam/Clindamycin Recommended for lung abscess or empyema and intra-abdominal infections Generally, not recommended for aspiration PNA (low quality evidence, guidelines mixed). Consider if poor dentition and higher likelihood of anaerobic involvement Atypical coverage: Consider if concern for community respiratory source (Azithromycin/Levofloxacin/Doxycycline); should be given to any patient admitted to ICU for community-acquired pneumonia Source Control: If unable to find source despite routine imaging, could consider PET vs tagged WBC scan De-escalation: When source control obtained, use susceptibilities, MRSA nasal swab results, and clinical evaluation to decide how and when to de-escalate and discontinue antimicrobials; procalcitonin trend may also be helpful in certain clinical situations Fluids: Initial resuscitation with at least 30 mL/kg (ideal body weight) of balanced IV crystalloid fluid (prefer LR > NS), given within the first 3 hours. - Assess fluid responsiveness with an intravascular volume assessment (leg raise, US IVC, pulse pressure) - Blood: When Hb < 7 or active and large volume bleed (Hb <8 for CAD, brisk bleed suspected) Post-Resuscitation Management: Access: Arterial line: Preferred for hemodynamic monitoring when in shock Central line: For pressor administration Can run peripherally if line is above the AC, levophed is running less than 15 mcg/min, and if needing for <48 hours Vasopressors: Start if MAPs persistently < 65 mmHg after fluid resuscitation Via CVC, PICC, or Port, or sometimes briefly peripherally (see above) Target MAP \u2265 65 mmHg.

Interventions with proven mortality benefit: Low tidal volume (Vt) ventilation (LTVV): - Goal Vt is 4-8 mL/kg of ideal body weight - Target plateau pressure of \u2264 30 cm H2O - Oxygenation goal: PaO2 55-80 mmHg or SpO2 88-95% - Slowly titrate PEEP and FiO2 concurrently to achieve oxygenation goals - pH goal: \u2265 7.20; \"permissive hypercapnia\"; titrate respiratory rate to target as normal pH as possible - Treat ventilator dyssynchrony Proning: - Can be considered if moderate to severe ARDS and oxygenation does not improve with LTVV - PROSEVA study (2013) demonstrated mortality benefit to early and prolonged proning (16 hours per day) in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (most significant benefit for severe) Interventions that probably won't hurt the patient but less data to support them: Conservative fluid management and IV diuresis as needed (at risk for pulmonary edema d/t vascular leak); goal of net even or negative. Note: FACTT study demonstrated 2 more days alive and off the ventilator with aggressive diuresis, but no mortality difference Glucocorticoids in ARDS d/t septic shock, COVID, CAP, steroid-responsive conditions; may shorten time on ventilator but may also result in some neuromuscular weakness American Thoracic Society Guidelines of 2024 placed emphasis on early ECMO involvement and neuromuscular blockade in severe ARDS patients. Two trials on neuromuscular blockade (ACURASYS and ROSE) with conflicting results. EOLIA suggest benefit to ECMO in patients with P/F <80 or hypercapnic respiratory acidosis. Intubation and Extubation Author: Jacob Lee Intubation This section will discuss how an ideal intubation will work; intubations during codes are emergent scenarios where this process will differ Indications: Respiratory failure \u2013 hypoxic and/or hypercapnic; NOTE hypercapnia with a normal pH is not a reason to intubate, this is well compensated Respiratory distress \u2013 angioedema or anaphylaxis with impending airway compromise, significantly increased work of breathing and pending ventilatory failure due to exhaustion Airway protection \u2013 altered mental status without ability protect airway (prevent aspiration and clear secretions); GCS <8 -> intubate Although recent study (NICO trial in JAMA) suggests that not intubating patients with acute overdose and GCS<8 is better (fewer complications, shorter ICU and hospital LOS) than intubation Airway trauma \u2013 damage or penetrating injuries to larynx Contraindications: Airway trauma/obstruction preventing safe placement of ETT; if definitive airway is needed in these cases, consider tracheostomy/cricothyrotomy Not within goals of care. Confirm code status with patient, family, or surrogate Considerations: Will the patient be able to be extubated? Is the underlying cause necessitating intubation treatable/reversible (severe, progressive neuromuscular disease)? Would a tracheostomy be within their goals of care? Is the intubation high risk? Difficult airway anatomy, physiologic instability, underlying comorbidities (pulmonary hypertension) increase the chance further decompensation with intubation If overnight, Airway team must be called. See the following \"Anesthesia Airway\" section chapter Checklist Assess the patient: - Airway predictors for difficult intubation: Mallampati \u2265 III, neck circumference > 40 cm, thyromental distance < 6cm, head-neck extension <30\u00b0, mouth unable to open > 34cm - High risk comorbidities: pulmonary hypertension with RV failure, angioedema, variceal hemorrhage, hemodynamic instability Prepare the patient: - Two large bore IVs - Position in the supine sniffing position, pre-oxygenate with 100% FiO2 and NIV if patient not actively vomiting - Optimize medical status: Give appropriate resuscitation, temporize anemia (hgb >7) /electrolyte abnormalities (hyperkalemia) Prepare the equipment: - Monitoring: SpO2, end-tidal CO2 monitor (capnography), continuous BP cycling, telemetry - Airway: Bag-valve mask, 2 endotracheal tubes (check cuffs prior to utilization), direct laryngoscope, video laryngoscope, bougie/stylet, suction device (on and functional), supraglottic and oropharyngeal airway as backup Prepare the medications: - Paralytic (succinylcholine or rocuronium), sedative - induction (etomidate or ketamine) and maintenance (propofol), analgesic for intubation (fentanyl) - Should have fluids, pressors, inotropes hanging in the room. Push-dose pressors (Neostick's=syringe of phenylephrine) also valuable NOTE: we are currently doing a clinical trial on sedatives and paralytics to see if there is a superior regimen Paralytic Agents: - Succinylcholine \u2013 depolarizing agent, faster onset (45-60 seconds), shorter duration (5-10 minutes) but should be avoided in hyperkalemia, burns, crush injuries, and neuromuscular disease (PD, MG, ALS) - Rocuronium \u2013 non-depolarizing agent, longer onset (45-90 seconds) longer duration (30-60 minutes) safer in CKD patients, as well as in NMD patients. Note, longer duration of action may outlast the duration of the induction sedative - risk for paralysis awareness Induction sedatives: - Etomidate \u2013 hemodynamically stable to slight hypotension - Ketamine \u2013 hemodynamically stable, can be dually helpful for bronchospasm - Propofol \u2013 associated with hypotension Prepare the team: - First and second intubators, RT, RN to prepare meds, RN to give meds, someone to monitor hemodynamics, someone with hand on the pulse - Run through the plan: meds to be given, meds available as backup Rapid-sequence intubation (RSI): Simultaneous administration of a sedative and paralytic to reduce patient movement and airway reflexes and quickly achieve optimal intubation conditions Goal is to intubate within 60 seconds of paralysis onset Preferred method of induction; associated with increased first-attempt success, reduced aspiration risk, reduced gastric insufflation, and even improved extubation rates Post-intubation: Ensure correct ETT placement: End-tidal CO2 color change (gold standard), bilateral breath sounds, and chest rise, absence of gastric sounds, CXR Secure the ETT with tape and/or tube holder Ventilate patients according to condition Complications: Airway trauma (oropharyngeal, laryngeal/vocal cords) Aspiration: Suction airway (ideally prior to initiation of PPV). Mixed data re whether cricoid pressure during intubation (i.e. Selleck maneuver) decreases risk of this. Desaturation/Hypoxia: Caused by inadequate preoxygenation, PTX, mucous plugging. Rescue maneuvers with bag-mask ventilation if necessary. Stat CXR Hypercapnia: Assess for cuff leaks - if underinflated or defective can lead to poor ventilation Cardiovascular collapse: intubation increases intrathoracic pressure and thus decreases venous return and CO; sedation vasodilates and decreases BP, sympathetic surge may trigger arrhythmia leading to cardiogenic shock. Manage with fluids/pressors if need, rule out other causes (ex: hypoxia, PTX) Mechanical injury: Dental, soft tissue, tracheal, laryngeal. Retrieve any dislodged teeth, suction blood Anesthesia Airway Editors: Mercede Erickson, MD, Camille Adajar, MD Faculty Editor: Brandon Pruett, MD Call/text Airway Phone: (615) 887-7369 Provides direct contact with the on-call resident/Airway Team (we also respond to all overhead STATs for airway management) Utilized during MICU night shifts or when the MICU attending is unavailable If the Airway Team is consulted for intubation, the anesthesia attending and residents will perform the intubation sequence and intubation \u2013 other team members are not permitted to intubate under these circumstances per Anesthesiology Department protocol Extubation Patients should be assessed for extubation readiness on a daily basis with SAT/SBT trials Spontaneous Awakening Trial (SAT) Contraindication: seizures, alcohol withdrawal, agitation, paralytics, MI, or increased ICP Pass: Patient is able to follow commands without significant anxiety, agitation, or respiratory distress as evidenced by vital signs. Precedex can be used if having trouble with agitation or anxiety Fail: Unable to cooperate/follow commands, clinically significant VS changes (new or worsening arrhythmia, tachypnea, hypoxia) If failed, restart sedation at reduced dose and titrate to RASS 0 (unless otherwise specified) Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT) Once SAT is passed Trial of pressure support (PS); PEEP \u22647.5cm H2O and FiO2 \u2264 50% for at least 30 minutes (ideal settings: PS 5cm H2O and PEEP 5cm H2O with FiO2 40%) Pass: No evidence of respiratory distress (tachypnea, bradypnea, hypoxia) Fail: Tachypnea (RR>35), bradypnea (RR <8), hypoxia (O2 sat < 88%), respiratory distress, cardiac arrhythmia, worsening hypotension; new hypertension (demonstrates increased work to maintain adequate breathing on SBT) Additional considerations prior to extubation: Has the underlying cause of their respiratory failure or need to be intubated improved? Is the patient able to protect their airway (coughing) and handle secretions? What does the patient need to be extubated to? (RA, LFNC, BiPAP) Preventative post-extubation BiPAP not routinely used in all pts but consider in select populations at high risk for failure: severe COPD with preexisting chronic hypercarbia, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, NMD, baseline airway regimen Is there a cuff leak, or lack thereof which will require pretreatment with steroids? Cuff leak test: Set ventilator to AC/VC and measure the TV. Deflate the ETT cuff completely, observe for an audible leak, and measure the difference in TV between delivered and exhaled breaths over 6 breathing cycles. Average the 3 lowest expiratory TV values Positive cuff leak: can hear audible leak, TV difference of >110-130 mL or > 10% between delivered and exhaled breath; significant variability in criteria A negative cuff leak test (lack of cuff leak) is not very accurate, but can indicate possible laryngeal edema and post-extubation airway obstruction/stridor Negative cuff leak is not an absolute CI to extubation. Will likely require steroids to minimize airway swelling IV Solumedrol 20 mg IV Q4hrs for 4 doses prior to extubation For borderline cases, calculate a Rapid Shallow Breathing Index (RSBI): - RR/TV (L) during their SBT or while on PS - RSBI > 105 is indicative of higher likelihood of reintubation; higher score = greater risk Post-Extubation: Consider ABG/VBG 20-30 mins after extubation to ensure adequate ventilation Airway clearance therapy should be available for patients with NMD, COPD/bronchiectasis, and those with heavy secretion burdens Extubating to BiPAP as described above has data supporting its use in certain scenarios. Note, rescue BiPAP to prevent re-intubation has not been shown to be beneficial and only found to delay reintubation. Exception: patient has known hypercapnea - then rescue BIPAP may actually rescue patients from re-intubation Complications: Laryngeal Edema/Stridor: Can occur even if positive cuff leak - Risk factors: Prolonged intubation \u22657 days, large ETT, repeated or traumatic intubation attempts, tracheal stenosis or upper airway mass, history of angioedema or anaphylaxis, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, ARDS - Treatment: 40 mg IV Solumedrol, inhaled racemic epinephrine and reassess in 60 minutes. If still present or patient has respiratory distress, consider re-intubation Post-extubation respiratory failure: hypoxic or hypercapnic - Risk factors: ARDS, PNA, Volume Overload, Sepsis - Consider blood gas 20-30 minutes post-extubation. Unless select high risk population discussed above, rescue BiPAP not shown to prevent re-intubation. If showing signs of respiratory distress, consider re-intubation. Modes of Oxygen Delivery Author: Jacob Lee Definitions: Entrainment \u2013 the process of oxygen being mixed with ambient air that impacts the true fraction of inspired oxygen delivered to the patient Non-Invasive modes of oxygenation augmentation These modes of oxygen delivery focus on oxygenation as opposed to ventilation System L/min % O2 Comments Blow by (ex: Trach collar) Depends on O2 delivery device 21-100% Used for patients who cannot tolerate more direct devices (agitated, cuffed tracheostomy tubes); how snug the trach collar is determines the degree of entrainment Nasal cannula 1-6 24 \u2013 45% Add 3-4% to Room Air FiO2 (21%) for each liter of supplemental oxygen administered. Flows in excess of 6 L/min will not appreciably increase the FiO2 Large bore nasal cannula Up to 15 Up to 80% This is NOT high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) although it may be documented in the chart as such. The nasal cannula prongs have a larger radius allowing for additional flow that will reliably increase flow rate up to 15 L/min Venturi mask 2 to 15 Up to 60% Color-coded adaptors allow for specific entrainment that deliver more accurate FiO2 delivery at given flows. Actual FiO2 is dependent on pt effort Non-rebreather 10 to 15 60-90% Reservoir bag is filled with pure oxygen, with one-way valves that prevent patient from breathing ambient air. Often used as a bridge to a higher tier of oxygen delivery HFNC: Optiflow, AirVo, Vapotherm 50-60 30-100% Used for hypoxic respiratory failure; although does deliver roughly 0.6-1.2 cm/H2O of PEEP per 10L of flow, not typically used for hypercapnic respiratory failure Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation Deliver set pressures by adjusting flow. Note, while flow and pressure are inter-related, they cannot be inter-converted. Pressure is maintained by regulating flow dynamically based on patient effort and lung mechanics Supplemental flow and FiO2 can be delivered into the tubing or blended into the machine (bled in) to give FiO2 reliably up to 60% (outpatient with oxygen bled in) or close to 100% (inpatient using high-flow devices) System Settings Indications Comments CPAP Pressure (CPAP), FiO2 OSA, Tracheomalacia FiO2 delivery varies due to leaks, mask type, and patient breathing pattern. Not indicated solely for oxygen delivery but can bleed oxygen in if hypoxia is also present BiPAP IPAP, EPAP (nomenclature is IPAP/EPAP), FiO2, RR Hypoxic and/or hypercapnic respiratory failure, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, prevention of post-extubation respiratory failure in high-risk patients Delta between IPAP and EPAP = driving pressure (higher driving pressure improves ventilation not oxygenation). Increasing EPAP can improve oxygenation by increased mean airway pressure but will not improve ventilation. FiO2 delivery varies due to pressure cycling, leaks, and inspiratory flow changes. Generally contraindicated if patient unable to remove mask themself, vomiting, or lots of secretions All of the above oxygen delivery systems are used in spontaneously breathing patients Invasive positive-pressure ventilation See \"Intubation and Extubation\" chapter (chapter prior to this one) for indications See \"Introduction to Ventilator Management\" below for ventilator modes Introduction to Vent Management Author: Seth Alexander See \"Intubation and Extubation\" for the clinical criteria to initiate or discontinue mechanical ventilation. Ventilator Settings: Trigger: what initiates a breath; time, flow, or pressure - Patient-initiated triggers are flow and pressure - Ventilator breaths are triggered by time Cycle: what terminates a breath Mode You set Not set Comments Pressure support (PS) PEEP PS above PEEP FiO2 TV RR Inspiratory flow - Used for spontaneous breathing trials (see intubation and extubation) and vent weaning - Patient is breathing on their own and will trigger each breath, setting their own flow, RR and TV - PS added to overcome the inherent resistance of the circuit Volume Control (AC/VC) PEEP RR TV Inspiratory flow FiO2 Inspiratory pressure - Patient or ventilator can trigger a breath; the breath is initiated when a preset tidal volume is delivered - Pros: Guarantees a minute ventilation and low tidal volume; will limit volutrauma - Cons: Pressure varies and may lead to lower mean airway pressure and thus less alveolar recruitment; if lungs become less compliant, the pressure needed to deliver set tidal volumes can become dangerously high causing risk of barotrauma SIMV Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation PEEP RR FiO2 If vent triggered breaths, TV If pt triggered breaths, PS above PEEP - Vent provides a set number of breaths at a set tidal volume. Patient can trigger breaths above this rate that are only supported by designated PS/PEEP (no set TV) - The ventilator tries to synchronize with the patient's breathing effort Pros: more comfortable, allows for spontaneous breathing Cons: Increased work of breathing if patient is tachypneic but not getting adequate TV with spont breaths, breath stacking if async w vent, does not guarantee MV - Numerous RCTs demonstrated that it's worse for vent weaning \u2013 associated with longer weans and fewer liberations Pressure Control (AC/PC) RR Inspiratory Pressure PEEP Inspiratory Time (or I:E ratio) FiO2 TV - Patient or ventilator can trigger breaths. All breaths supported. The breath is cycled when the preset inspiratory time is reached - The ventilator maintains a constant pressure during inspiration (flow decreases as the lungs fill with air) Pros: theoretically better for oxygenation - maintains a more consistent mean airway pressure, limits barotrauma Cons: Tidal volume, and therefore, MV is not guaranteed, requires close monitoring as TV and MV may drop if lung compliance decreases (need to increase low MV alarm threshold manually) PRVC Pressure Regulated Volume Control PEEP RR TV Inspiratory flow Pressure max FiO2 - Attempts to reach a set volume by adjusting the pressure (same triggers and cycles as AC/VC) - Vent will average the preceding few breaths to try and deliver a desired tidal volume at the lowest possible pressure Pros: Tries to limit both volutrauma and barotrauma Cons: If conflict between the VC and PC aspects (e.g. ARDS), PC will supersede - cannot guarantee MV. The more work the patient does, the less the ventilator does and patients may be prone to 'tiring out' \u2013 should monitor PCO2 with blood gases APRV / Bilevel PEEP (PLow) Pressure High Time Low Time High FiO2 TV - The ventilator cycles between P(high) and P(low) based on preset times but the patient is allowed to breathe spontaneously at any time - Usually, long periods of inspiratory holds with brief expirations - Pros: Used for refractory hypoxemia - increases mean airway pressure and alveolar recruitment - Cons: Does not guarantee MV, risk of air trapping and hyperinflation due to auto-PEEP and breath-stacking, often difficult to ventilate patients Static Ventilator Readouts: Plateau pressure (Pplat): Measured with an inspiratory hold (assesses lung compliance) Auto-PEEP: Measured with an expiratory hold; occurs when volume of previous breath is not entirely expelled before the next breath is initiated Dynamic Ventilator Readouts: Measured RR: In most modes, patients may trigger breaths more frequently than the set RR; if set and measured RR match, consider \u2193 respiratory drive (sedation, neurologic injury) or iatrogenic over-ventilation Tidal volume of inspiration (VTi) and expiration (VTe) VTi should approximately equal VTe. If not, then assess for an air leak (e.g. cuff leak or pneumothorax) or auto-PEEP Minute ventilation: calculated from VTe x RR; higher MV = more CO2 clearance Peak (Inspiratory) pressure (PIP): Highest pressure reached in the entire ventilator cycle Critical non-ventilator hemodynamic readouts: SpO2: If poor waveform or discordant with measured PaO2, exchange the probe or consider serial ABGs HR: Can be an indicator of emergencies such as pneumothorax, PE, ventilator disconnection Blood pressure: Positive pressure ventilation decreases preload and has mixed effects on afterload (pulmonary vascular resistance vs. systemic afterload) by altering intrathoracic pressure gradients. Depending on the patient's pathophysiology, increases in positive pressure may be detrimental or beneficial for BP It is helpful, when you first have a ventilated patient, to review the equipment that makes up the \"circuit\" from the ventilator to the patient and back with an RT or bedside nurse. - Key things to know: How to inline suction, perform an inspiratory hold, reconnect/disconnect the circuit to the ETT if needing to bag the patient, etc. Troubleshooting vent alarms: Alarm Type What is causing the alarm? Troubleshooting High Peak Pressure Dynamic compliance issue (resistance of the circuit when there is air flowing) vs. Static compliance issue (stretch of the lung - doesn't change with airflow) Step 1: Check plateau pressure by performing inspiratory hold. Must be in VC mode. High Peak and Low Plateau: Dynamic compliance issue \u2192 High Resistance Work outside -> in: - Check if pt is biting on the ETT - Incline suction to clear secretions or proximal mucous plug - Check circuit tubing for excess water condensation, mucous plug, or a kink. Ask RT to disconnect and clear circuit - Auscultate for wheezing/stridor to indicate bronchospasm or obstruction \u2192 give bronchodilators High Peak and High Plateau: Static compliance issue \u2192 Worsening alveolar process Emergencies: tension PTX, mainstem intubation Work Outside -> in: - Obesity/chest wall rigidity - Abdominal Compartment syndrome/ascites - Single Lung: mucous plug, large pleural effusion/atelectasis - Worsening alveolar process - pulmonary edema, PNA, DAH, ARDS - CXR, b-lines on US, tracheal aspirate, bronchoscopy, etc. Low Tidal Volume/Low Minute Ventilation (VE) Patient is not getting the desired (set) tidal volume/VE. The alarm reports exhaled VE. This may cause inadequate ventilation, CO2 retention, and potentially hypoxia. 1. Put patient back on VC, assess for high peak pressures (-> low volume in certain vent modes) 2. Compare inspiratory tidal volumes (Vti) with expiratory tidal volumes (Vte) on the ventilator. If Vti>Vte, check for a leak in the system: - Check circuit for connection leaks w RT - Listen for a cuff leak \u2013 can have RT check a cuff pressure and if low re-inflate \u2192 sometimes need to do an ETT exchange - Ensure ETT not high or out 3. Consider disconnecting vent and bagging pt If normal resistance: - Leak in ventilator, tubing, or Y-adapter If low resistance: - Cuff leak, ETT above cords, or bronchopleural fistula If low tidal volumes and no leak (ie. Vti = Vte) and RR WNL: - Patient may need more support (i.e. switching to a different vent mode (PS to PRVC)). Discuss with RT or fellow If low RR and no leak and Vt at goal: - Patient may be over-sedated - May need to increase set/back-up ventilator respiratory rate Apnea No breaths are being triggered by the vent\u2026 in other words, your pt is NOT breathing \u2192 this is an emergency\u2026 Check that the patient hasn't self-extubated, their trach hasn't fallen out, or they haven't been unhooked from vent If self-extubated or tracheostomy decannulated, then immediately start bagging the pt (may need to bag from trach stoma if s/p laryngectomy) Have nurse call staff assist for re-intubation if necessary or have trach team called to replace a fresh (<7 days old) trach Refractory Hypoxemia Author: Hannah Kieffer Background Inadequate arterial oxygenation despite high levels of inspired O2 or the development of barotrauma in mechanically ventilated pts Oxygen index (MAP \u00d7 FiO2 \u00d7 100/PaO2) < 40 Consider work up/interventions below if needing FiO2 >80% Differential: Always first consider worsening of primary underlying process Consider recent injuries/interventions, e.g., smoke inhalation, opioid administration and check dose, recent blood transfusion, etc. Altered alveolar permeability/V-Q mismatch: PE, pneumothorax, fluid overload (severe pleural effusion/pulmonary edema), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), new ARDS, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage Shunting: Large lung consolidation, bronchus obstruction, intracardiac shunt, intrapulmonary shunt (pulmonary AVMs) Evaluation: Always get CXR STAT if pt has new or worsening O2 requirement Consider CT chest if patient stable enough CBC, ABG POCUS: Lack of lung sliding; pneumothorax RV enlargement/septal bowing/McConnell's sign; RV strain in PE TTE if stable and concerned for intracardiac shunt/acute HF decompensation Bronchoscopy if concerned for mucous plug Management Algorithm for refractory hypoxemia Initial triaging maneuvers: - If at any point the pt is rapidly decompensating, you can always disconnect them from the vent and bag them until they recover/while calling for help - Troubleshoot ventilator \u2013 see \"Introduction to Vent Management\" for more information - Optimize fluid status; consider diuresis/dialysis if not making significant urine - Reposition patient \u2013 elevated HOB, position \"good lung\" down Consider higher PEEP strategy: - Increased PEEP -> higher mean airway pressure. Generally, improves oxygenation especially with diffuse pulmonary pathologies - Exceptions may include certain focal/shunt pathologies (e.g. dense lobar PNA) - Worsening oxygenation may occur with overdistension of alveoli -> increased dead space ventilation; generally determined empirically at the bedside - Titrate up slowly; generally, do not exceed PEEP 18 - Limited by high plateau pressures/barotrauma, overdistension/dead space ventilation, decreased preload/venous return - ARDS net FiO2/PEEP Tables: At VUMC we typically use the Lower PEEP table - Note - Updated 2024 guidelines conditionally recommend use of higher PEEP (reduced mortality and fewer ventilator days) without prolonged lung recruitment maneuvers (higher mortality) Lower PEEP/higher FiO2 FiO2 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.5 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.7 PEEP 5 5 8 8 10 10 10 12 FiO2 0.7 0.8 0.9 0.9 0.9 1.0 PEEP 14 14 14 16 18 18-24 Higher PEEP/lower FiO2 FiO2 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.5 PEEP 5 8 10 12 14 14 16 16 FiO2 0.5 0.5-0.8 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.0 PEEP 18 20 22 22 22 24 Inhaled vasodilators: Distribute preferentially to well-ventilated alveoli ->local vasodilation -> improved V/Q matching - VUMC formulary preference: Inhaled epoprostenol (aka Flolan) - Alternatives: Inhaled milrinone, inhaled nitric oxide - Data suggest they improve PaO2/FiO2; large RCT without evidence for mortality benefit Deep sedation (RASS -4 or -5) - Promotes ventilator synchrony Neuromuscular blockade (paralysis) \u2013 call your fellow before doing this - Maximal vent synchrony (eliminates residual chest wall/diaphragm tone) - Pt MUST be RASS -5 (need analgesia + sedation) - Trial one time IV push of vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg - If improved vent synchrony/oxygenation, consider cisatracurium (Nimbex) drip - Data are mixed; ACURASYS 2010 (improved 90-day mortality but underpowered likely overestimating benefit); ROSE 2019 (no difference in 90-day mortality) Prone positioning (Need attending approval) - Pts with moderate to severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 150) - At VUMC, we use regular ICU beds and manually flip pts; cycle prone 16h/supine 8h - When proning or supining a pt, always have a provider who can intubate in the room in case unplanned extubation occurs - Considerations: need a team of people to reposition, high risk of ET tube malposition, difficult to access lines/perform procedures, high risk of pressure injuries - Data: PROSEVA 2013 - proning improved 28-day mortality; note study c/b imbalances between groups Alternative ventilator modes (usually PC or APRV/BiLevel/BiVent) - APRV/BiVent should be avoided in people with bad obstructive lung dx, hemodynamic instability, refractory hypercarbia - No data that demonstrates superiority of any one ventilator mode over another Venovenous (V-V) ECMO - CONSULT EARLY if a pt may be a candidate; allows ECMO team to assist with evaluation - Hypoxemia related indications: - PaO2/FiO2 < 50 with FiO2 >80% for >3h OR - PaO2/FiO2 < 80 with FiO2 >80% for >6h - PaO2 <40 mmHg despite maximal ventilator support - Murray Score \u2265 3 - Absolute Contraindications: - Poor short-term prognosis/non-survival comorbidity (e.g. metastatic cancer) - Irreversible, devastating neurologic pathology - Irreparable cardiac damage and unsuitable for transplant/VAD - Chronic respiratory insufficiency without the possibility for transplant - Limitation of care orders (DNR) - Can calculate RESP score; predicts in-hospital survival with ECMO - Data: - Included in updated 2024 ATS practice guidelines - CESAR 2009: Improved 6-month survival without severe disability - EOLIA 2018: No mortality benefit but 28% crossover from control to ECMO arm dilutes potential effects. ECMO group had a significant increase in ventilator-free days Refractory Hypercapnia Author: Hannah Kieffer Background: Definition: Inadequate clearance of CO2 leading to respiratory acidosis (pH \u2264 7.20) despite maximum RR&TV (i.e. minute ventilation) tolerated without causing barotrauma or autoPEEP Common causes: Obstructive lung disease (COPD, emphysema, asthma) Hypoventilation syndromes (congenital central hypoventilation, brainstem injury, sleep apnea, obesity, sedative medications (i.e. opiates), neuromuscular weakness, chest wall trauma, ascites/pleural effusion) Increased CO2 load (shock, sepsis, malignant hyperthermia) Presentation: Shortness of breath, AMS, somnolence, hypoxemia, tachycardia, HTN (in some cases) Evaluation: Physical exam, mental status, recent medications ABG or VBG Respiratory acidosis: Expect high CO2; normal pH suggests chronic condition with compensation vs low pH suggests more acuity If increased PCO2 and normal pH, always treat the pH and not the PCO2 (i.e., if compensated chronic hypercarbia, decreasing CO2 below what the patient has adapted to -> decreased respiratory drive, cerebral vasoconstriction, Bohr effect) Management Algorithm: Maximize conventional ventilation strategies: - Consider HFNC or BiPAP if safe - If refractory (PaCO2 >60 mmHg for >6 hours w pH <7.25), consider ECCO2R - Consider escalation to V-V ECMO Special considerations: - If history of OSA, make sure they are on home CPAP/BiPAP - If opiate related, trial Narcan - If reactive airway disease contributing, bronchodilators BiPAP: - Contraindicated if pt unable to remove BiPAP mask independently - Increase MV by increasing \u0394 between IPAP/EPAP or increasing RR Mechanical ventilation: - Allows you to control rate and TV (in VC modes) - To increase MV and CO2 clearance: - Increase RR: - Up to ~30-35 breaths/min - Need to keep in mind I/E time to avoid breath stacking/autoPEEP - Evidence of autoPEEP: Increased WOB/vent dyssynchrony, worsening hypotension, and failure of the expiratory limb on the flow waveform on the vent to return to zero - Possible corrective measures: Lower RR, decrease inspiratory time, increase expiratory phase time - Increase TV: - Usually start at 4-6mL/kg PBW. Can consider increasing to 8mL/kg PBW as long as plateau pressures remain < 30 cm H2O - Goal peak pressures \u2264 35 cmH2O / plateau pressures \u2264 30 cmH2O - If ARDS, allow for permissive hypercapnia (goal pH \u2265 7.2) V-V ECMO / Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R): - Indications for ECMO for hypercapnia: - Severe dynamic hyperinflation and/or severe respiratory acidosis - pH \u2264 7.20 with PaCO2 \u2265 60 for 6h with RR at 35/min and TV increased to target maximum MV while keeping plateau pressure \u2264 32 cmH2O - Similar considerations and contraindications as refractory hypoxemia (see above) - Benefits: Reduces work of breathing, promotes early ventilator weaning/extubating -> allows early mobilization and recovery Tracheostomy Author: Alice Kennedy Indications for Tracheostomy: Prolonged mechanical intubation and weaning (typically consider ~ day 14) Prior failed extubation attempt(s) Tracheal stenosis Upper airway obstructions (e.g., head and neck cancers, severe infections, congenital obstructions) Trauma Neuromuscular disease Benefits of Tracheostomy vs ET tube: Lower risk of laryngeal and vocal cord damage Improved ability to communicate (i.e. speaking valve) Improved pt comfort and decreased need for sedation Lower airway resistance -> reduced work of breathing May reduce time to wean from the vent and hospital LOS (mixed data) Potential improvement in patient mobility Easier access to trachea for suctioning/airway hygiene May decrease risk of ventilator associated pneumonia (Mixed data) Note: No proven reduction in short-term mortality Timing of Tracheostomy: Generally performed after 2 weeks of intubation (timing not backed by data) Pts that might get tracheostomy earlier: Anticipated prolonged mechanical ventilation (i.e. those with acute neurologic injury affecting spinal cord) Research: No benefit in 30-day mortality rates or hospital length of stay for early (day 4) vs late (day 10) tracheostomy in TracMan trial (Tracheostomy Management trial, 2013) *NOTE: Many patients in late trach group did not end up requiring one Tracheostomy Tubes: Most common in hospital = Portex (Previously Shiley) Components: Faceplate/Flange: Keeps tube in place, has the model and size on it Inner cannula: Can be removed, cleaned, and replaced in case of obstruction Cuff (may or may not have): Allows for pt to be ventilated; may prevent some aspiration. Pressure needs to be assessed qshift and kept <30mmHg Fenestration (i.e. holes in the cannula) (may or may not have): Allow speaking without valve Obturator/Trocar: Kept at the bedside to assist with trach insertion/removal Common sizes: Initial: 8-0; Standard downsizing: 6-0 (Sizing: Comparable to ETT size for Portex) Lengths: Standard vs. larger XLT (P = longer proximal end, D = longer distal end) Presenting on ICU rounds = size/cuff status/brand (e.g. 8-0 cuffed Portex) \"Trach collar\" means pt is receiving just humidified O2/room air, cuff should be down Speaking Valves: Passy Muir Valve (PMV): One-way valve placed on the outer portion of the trach; air moves in with inspiration but is blocked and thus funneled up around/outside the trach and through the vocal cords during exhalation allowing for phonation Contraindications: Severe upper airway obstruction or aspiration risk, copious secretions, decreased cognitive status, severe medical instability, or inability to tolerate cuff deflation IMPORTANT SAFETY PRINCIPLE: Cuff must be deflated when PMV is on. Since air needs to be able to travel back up the airway, if the cuff is not deflated and you put the PMV on then pt cannot exhale. Must remove when asleep. Maintenance of Tracheostomy Tubes: Inner cannula should be cleaned 2-3 times per day or swapped (disposable) Daily stoma care to prevent pressure ulcers and stoma infections As needed suctioning for secretions Complications and airway emergencies in a tracheostomy pt: Hemorrhage (mild bleeding from surface vessels and granulation tissue is common, major bleeding is rare - think erosion into brachiocephalic [innominate] artery) Causes for alarm: Drop in sats/Hgb, new tachycardia or hypotension, increasing PIP, new/worsening bleeding, or large clots Airway damage - subglottic or tracheal stenosis, tracheobronchitis Fistulas (tracheoarterial, tracheoesophageal) Unintended tracheostomy tube dislodgement: All pts with trachs have a yellow sign above bed with date, type, size of trach as well as a replacement trach with obturator in the room Fresh trach (\u2264 14 days): do NOT replace due to risk of misplacement into the mediastinum and loss of airway; airway management from above Older trach: can be replaced at bedside with obturator by trained staff In the case of an EMERGENCY: Bag mask (use hand/gauze to occlude stoma) or intubate from above (i.e. through the mouth); if complete laryngectomy then must use stoma Contact Surgical Airway Emergency Team +/- Team that placed it Secretion Management: Respiratory hygiene (\"pulmonary toilet\"): heated vent, guaifenesin (may not have an effect), hypertonic saline, DuoNebs, cough assist device, appropriate suctioning (too much -> worsens secretions), acapella, IS Decannulation: Candidates: Need to protect their airway and be on minimal FiO2 settings Should pass capping trials and tolerate PMV for most of the day Avoid if imminently discharging/planning for procedures ABCDEF (A2F) Bundle Author: Kaele Leonard Background Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS): complex constellation of cognitive, physical, and psychological impairments that impact most survivors of critical illness, leading to disability, frailty, and poor quality of life Predicted by (1) duration of immobility and (2) delirium Both are reduced by >80% compliance with ABCDEF (A2F) Bundle concepts ABCDEF (A2F) Bundle: Interprofessional, evidence-based safety bundle of care principles to help reduce LOS, mortality, bounce-backs, and the duration of ICU delirium and coma Goal: allow pt to \"prove us wrong\" about readiness for liberation from devices, sedatives, etc. Assess, prevent, and manage pain Tools to assess pain using facial expressions, body movements, muscle tension, compliance with ventilator, or vocalization for extubated pts Ex: Critical Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT): scale 0-8, uncontrolled pain >=3 Uncontrolled pain increases risk for delirium, limits inspiratory effort & weaning from ventilator, and limits ability to mobilize Treatment: multi-modal: parenteral opioids, neuropathic meds (e.g., gabapentin, ketamine), adjunctive non-opioids analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen, NSAIDs), nonpharmacologic interventions (repositioning, heat/cold) Both spontaneous awakening trials (SATs) and spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) SATs = daily sedative interruptions - RN-driven protocol involving safety checklist: no active seizures, alcohol withdrawal, agitation, paralytics, myocardial infarction, or increased ICP - If pass SAT, proceed to SBT - If fail SAT (anxiety, agitation, pain, resp distress) \u2192 restart sedation at \u00bd doses SBTs = PS ventilation (Fi02 \u2264 50%, PEEP \u2264 7.5;

It is largely interchangeable with Encephalopathy. This becomes more difficult to assess when patients are sedated, intubated, etc. in the ICU Very well-studied at VUMC, more resources found at: https://www.icudelirium.org Associated with higher morbidity and mortality compared to those who do not experience delirium and duration of delirium also associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Evaluation Can present as either hyperactive (agitated, trying to leave bed, etc.) or hypoactive (somnolent, minimally interactive, etc.). Do neuro exam to rule out focal deficits. Basic ICU/coma neuro exam: Component Assessment Level of consciousness If not alert and oriented, test if they are redirectable/open eyes to loud voice CN II (also III) Pupillary light reflex - check pupillary size + rate of constriction, symmetry CN III/IV/VI Eye tracking to voice, roaming around room CN V/VII Corneal blink reflex - can use NS syringes to drop water into eyes CN VIII (also III + VI) Oculocephalic reflex - turn head left/right, eyes should compensate to fix in forward position CN IX/X Cough/Gag - Can test with tongue depressor. If intubated, can advance/retract OG tube for gag and endotracheal tube suction catheter for cough CN XI Difficult in delirious/intubated patients, can check for Shoulder shrugging with pain response CN XII Difficult in delirious/intubated patients, can monitor for Spontaneous tongue movements Extremities +Withdrawal to pain: Pt appears to voluntarily, non-stereotypically withdraw limbs to vigorous nailbed pressure, sternal rub, trapezius pinch +Localization of pain: Pt will attempt to reach to side of painful stimulus +Muscle Tone: relaxed at baseline, no abnormal flexion/extension IE posturing +Presence of abnormal reflexes: Unilateral hyper-/hypoactive reflexes, rapid & transient stereotyped movements to noxious stimuli IE triple flexion, up-going Babinski, ankle clonus For ICU Patients, consider sedation when doing neuro exam - propofol and other anesthesia dampens brainstem + peripheral reflexes Always remember patients can be encephalopathic and evolve another acute neurological syndrome. Follow up any odd/changing exam findings. Perform the CAM-ICU for scoring \u2013 ICU nurses perform this q4h as part of routine ICU care See RASS scoring table in ABCDEF Bundle Critical Care chapter. Differential Diagnosis for ICU Delirium Most typically due to changes in environment, alterations in sleep cycle, reduced cognitive reserve from critical illness, dementia, neurodegeneration, etc. Other differentials fit in a modified VITAMINS PO mnemonic: Category Differential Diagnoses Vascular Ischemic stroke, CNS hemorrhage, arrhythmia, carotid stenosis Infectious +Any severe illness, UTI & PNA are most common +Also consider meningitis/encephalitis Trauma Falls, TBI, etc. Autoimmune Autoimmune encephalitis, SLE, CNS vasculitis among others Metabolic +Constipation +Hypo/hyperthyroidism, hypoglycemia, AKI, hypercalcemia, hyperammonemia (IE hepatic encephalopathy), severe hyponatremia, Uremia among many others +Vitamin deficiencies - thiamine and B12 especially Ingestion +Illicits, Opiates, Benzos, barbiturates, anti-psychotics, anti-cholinergics, cefepime +Withdrawal syndromes - EtOH/benzos/opioids especially, also SSRI's/daily psych meds Neoplasm Brain mets, primary CNS tumors, CA associated with paraneoplastic syndromes (SCLC, Multiple myeloma, ovarian teratoma, etc.) Seizure Pain Always important to consider, especially in geriatric pts Oxygenation Hypoxia Management Initial toxic/metabolic/infectious workup can include: CBC, CMP, TSH, Folate, Vitamin B12, UA, blood cultures, CT Head w/o. Look through med list to see if there are any sedating medications that could be contributing and try to minimize as much as possible. Definitive treatment is addressing underlying etiology. First-line symptomatic treatment includes delirium precautions, such as keeping blinds open during daytime, limiting daytime naps, redirection when agitated, lights on during day, TV on during day, family at bedside (opposite of these at night). There is an order in Epic called Nursing: Delirium Care, which can be found as part of the Geriatric Delirium Care order set, that has all these precautions listed out. Although they do not provide mortality benefit in ICU delirium patients (and debatably worsen mortality), antipsychotics can be used if needed for more severe agitation IE pulling at lines, physical aggression. Start with one-time dose of zyprexa 2.5 mg or 5 mg, can escalate to 1 mg haldol if refractory. Check an EKG for QTc prolongation (>440ms) prior to giving.

Have we confirmed the pt's code status? Calmly take charge: Establish if anyone is actively running the code. If someone is running the code, introduce yourself and ask how you may be helpful. If someone is NOT, assume responsibility for running the code 1st Minute: Check in on ABCDE A: Airway \u2013 Check that patient is receiving breaths; do they need an airway adjunct? B: Breathing \u2013 Is someone bagging the patient effectively? C: Compressions \u2013 Has someone started chest compressions? Have 2-3 people in line to take over during pulse checks D: Defibrillation \u2013 Are there pads on the patient? E: Epinephrine \u2013 Make sure first dose has been given 2nd Minute: Set up your room You/the code leader stands at the foot of the bed. Do not move. One person on chest compressions; 2-3 people in a line behind to take over during pulse checks Airway manager at head of bed. Have second person to assist/hold the mask Someone monitoring femoral pulse Medication administrator Timer/Recorder Be clear and remove extra people out of the room Now that your code is running: Access: IV access preferred, if no immediate IV access, place IO Obtain a brief medical history and events surrounding the code Interventions with proven mortality benefit: Strong ACLS: - Check that high quality CPR with minimal interruptions (<10s) - Change compressors during pulse checks to decrease interruptions - Q2min - pulse check, rhythm check, shock? - Do NOT pause compressions for intubation - Restart CPR immediately after defibrillation - do not check pulse until after 1 additional round of CPR after defibrillation, even if possible perfusing rhythm returns Early Defibrillation: Assess the rhythm - If Vfib/VT, immediately shock - For polymorphic VT, this is ischemia until proven otherwise unless the pt is on a large amount of QTc prolonging medications - If PEA/Asystole - resume compressions Epinephrine: Given every 3-5mins during CPR Consider Advanced Airway: - Intubation is not proven to increase survival over bag-mask ventilation - Remember chest compressions save lives, not intubation. Do NOT stop compressions for intubation H's and T's: - Treat Reversible Factors - Some of the fellows here will empirically give 2 grams of magnesium, 1 amp of D50, 1 amp of bicarb, and 1g calcium chloride at the onset of the code irrespective of presenting rhythm Treatable Causes of Cardiac Arrest: H's T's Hypoxia Toxins Hypovolemia Tamponade H+ Tension Pneumothorax Hypo/Hyper K Thrombosis: Pulmonary Hypothermia Thrombosis: Coronary Miscellaneous Advice: Closed Loop communication - continue giving instructions, minimize interruptions It can be helpful to maintain a constant verbal running summary of the course of the code and interventions that have been tried Have a member of the team locate an ultrasound for line placement and diagnostics Once code is underway, you have more time to understand specifics of patient. Ask bedside nurse for more past medical and more immediate history. Have someone look up most recent labs in Epic (looking for recent hyperK, acidosis). Can send Labs \u2013 ask for a \"loaded gas\" Allow family to be present if they want. Very Important: If family present, ensure that a healthcare provider (nurse, APP, resident, attending) is with the family (to answer questions, explain what is going on) Terminating a Code Consider initial rhythm, pt comorbidities, cardiac vs non-cardiac arrest, bedside echo findings. ROSC or rhythm changes during code? Persistent ETCO2 < 10 mmHg after 20min CPR has minimal survival Ask your team if they have any other therapies that they feel would be indicated Ask if anyone remains in favor of continuing CPR When unanimous, terminate the code and announce time of death. Thank your team. Take a moment of silence for the deceased patient Post-Arrest Care Immediately following ROSC is the most dangerous point of ACLS Airway: Secure airway if not done during code. Avoid hypoxia AND hyperoxia BP: MAPs < 65, IVF and/or pressors if needed If on floor, prioritize moving pt to a unit for ongoing care once hemodynamically stable enough for transfer. Would not delay for other diagnostics/interventions (lines, CXR, etc) Cardiac: Obtain EKG. Assess if urgent cardiac intervention is required for STEMI vs unstable cardiogenic shock vs VT storm or Vfib Neuro: If not following commands, consider Targeted Temperature Management. TTM is still performed at VUMC with a strict protocol and inclusion criteria. If there is any question about TTM eligibility, page the CCU fellow Send rainbow labs (CBC, CMP, Mg, coags, trop, lactate, VBG/ABG).

This is a very important experience. Temperature Abnormalities Author: Soibhan Kelley Hypothermia Background Core temperature <35\u00b0C (95\u00b0F). Mild 32-35C (90-95F), moderate 28-32C (82-90F), or severe <28C (82F) +/- pulseless Ensure thermometer is \"low-reading,\" standard thermometers not accurate Core temperature can be measured w/ bladder catheter probe or esophageal probe (may be falsely \u2193 if heated oxygen being delivered). Rectal temp can be used but is less accurate Etiologies: Heat loss: environmental, burns, iatrogenic (CRRT, cold IVF, massive transfusion protocol), vasodilatory drugs/toxins Decreased heat production: endocrinopathies (hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypopituitarism, hypoglycemia), thiamine deficiency Impaired regulation: Spinal cord injury, hypothalamic lesions, drugs (classes including antihyperglycemics, beta blockers, sedatives, ETOH, alpha agonists, general anesthetics) Multiple mechanisms: sepsis, pancreatitis, DKA Evaluation Infectious work-up POC blood glucose, TSH/FT4, cortisol, lipase, UA, UDS, EtOH level, additional tox as appropriate, DKA work-up if relevant Physical exam + history for exposures and trauma CBC, CMP, Lactate, ABG, CK, PT/PTT, Fibrinogen EKG Management Treat underlying cause [see appropriate sections] Mild hypothermia: Passive external rewarming (PER): blankets, increase ambient temperature Note that PER requires sufficient underlying physiologic reserve to generate heat. This is often impaired in elderly pts, malnutrition, sepsis Moderate hypothermia, refractory mild hypothermia, or cardiovascular instability: Active external rewarming (AER): forced warm air (ie Bair Hugger), heated blankets, heat lamps, hot packs (consider burn risk) Severe hypothermia or refractory moderate hypothermia: Active core rewarming: Warmed IV crystalloid (limited rewarming potential unless large volume but will decrease ongoing losses), warmed humidified inspired air, warmed bladder lavage More extreme methods such as peritoneal/thoracic lavage more likely to be used in severe environmental cases in ED Pulseless severe hypothermia (\"You aren't dead unless you are warm and dead\"): Continue CPR until re-warmed as severe hypothermia is neuroprotective and pts can have good neurologic outcomes despite hours of CPR ACLS medications and shocks will have poor effectiveness; prioritize circulation (i.e. chest compressions) and rewarming Consider ECMO (likely venoarterial if pulseless); would need transfer to CVICU Identify and manage complications: bradycardia/heart block, arrhythmias, shock, coagulopathy/DIC, rhabdomyolysis; rebound hyperkalemia/hypoglycemia with rewarming Fever and Hyperthermia Background Fever: T >38.0\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) driven by hypothalamus activity in response to systemic triggers (i.e. cytokines); may use lower threshold for immunocompromised pts Hyperthermia: T >41.0 C (105.8\u00b0F) uncontrolled heat production with failure of thermoregulation Infectious etiologies: Considerations in the ICU include central-line associated blood stream infection, catheter-associated UTI, pneumonia (including ventilator-associated), sinusitis (esp. in pts with NGT or ETT), clostridium difficile, acalculous cholecystitis Non-infectious etiologies: Drug fever: Difficult to distinguish from other causes; Can begin hrs-wks after starting a drug Sources: antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, sulfonamides), anticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital), allopurinol, heparin, dexmedetomidine Drugs of abuse with sympathomimetic activity (cocaine, meth, ecstasy) Anticholinergic or salicylate intoxication Idiosyncratic drug reactions: Serotonin syndrome Neuroleptic malignant syndrome Malignant hyperthermia Transfusion reactions PE/DVT Endocrine: hyperthyroidism/thyroid storm, adrenal insufficiency CNS pathology (intracranial bleed/stroke, particularly hypothalamic region) Malignancy Heat stroke (exertional or non-exertional) Other inflammatory states: Pancreatitis, gout, pericarditis, pneumonitis Evaluation Infectious work-up +/- LP;

Calcium, iron, PPIs interfere the most with absorption. Of note, missed doses can be taken along with the next dose. Symptoms improve in 2-3 weeks. TSH steady state requires 6 weeks. Dose can be titrated every 6 weeks based on TSH. Pregnancy: Pregnancy causes lab changes due to differing levels thyroid binding globulin. Use tables based on trimester to interpret values.

If steroids will be tapered or discontinued soon after, either continue hospital regimen for remainder of steroid course or return to home regimen (hyper >hypoglycemia). Additional Information Weight-based insulin dosing Used when starting insulin on pts with type 2 DM who are insulin na\u00efve and hyperglycemic in the hospital Calculate total daily dosing (TDD) between 0.3 to 0.5 units/kg/day. Then split into 50% bolus and 50% as 3 divided prandial doses E.g. 80kg pt using low start of 0.3 u/kg/day would have TDD of 24 units.

Rarely heal spontaneously, therefore will require surgical correction. Bleeding: most common cause of overt lower GI bleeding in adults, typically resolves spontaneously. If persistent, endoscopic intervention to locate and stop the bleeding; if hemodynamically unstable, angiography is the next step to locate and/or control the bleed. If bleeding persists and patient is unstable, segmental colectomy can be performed if the site of bleeding is clearly located with endoscopy/angiography; if no site is found, subtotal colectomy can be performed. Surgical management for a diverticular bleed is rare and should be a last resort approach. Perforation: Microperforation (contained perforation): Presence of small amount of air bubbles, but no oral contrast outside of colon on CT Most treated with IV antibiotics and bowel rest like uncomplicated diverticulitis Frank perforation (contained perforation): Intraabdominal free air, air under the diaphragm, and diffuse peritonitis requires emergency surgery so consult EGS Recurrent diverticulitis: elective surgery generally not recommended for patients with prior diverticulitis episodes if they were managed medically and uncomplicated. Indications for elective surgery include patients who have had a prior episode of complicated diverticulitis or are immunosuppressed. Surgery typically performed 10-12 weeks after last acute diverticulitis episode Segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis (SCAD) Definition: chronic mucosal inflammation in a segment of colon with diverticula Pathogenesis: currently unknown, leading hypotheses include fecal stasis, localized ischemia, and mucosal prolapse Symptoms: chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, intermittent hematochezia Diagnosis: colonoscopy with chronic inflammatory changes on biopsy only in an area of the colon with diverticula (sigmoid colon>>descending colon) and absence of inflammation in the rectum (compared to ulcerative colitis, which always involves the rectum) Rule out other causes: acute uncomplicated diverticulitis (increased paracolic fat stranding/mild colonic wall inflammation, endoscopy shows primary involvement of diverticular orifices and peri diverticular mucosa), infectious colitis (stool studies/tissue biopsy), NSAID-induced colitis (medication exposure), ischemic colitis (acute presentation), IBD (UC involves rectum, CD typically involves other sites in GI tract), radiation colitis (history of radiation, tissue biopsy showing eosinophils) Management: Start with antibiotics (cipro or flagyl x 10-14 days), if unresponsive, add oral mesalamine x 7-10 days with dose escalation if persistent after 2 weeks. If symptoms remain, start prednisone 40 mg and gradually taper over 6 weeks. Acute Pancreatitis Author: Kristijan Bogdanovski Background Common causes: Gallstones (40%), EtOH (30%) Other causes: post-ERCP, pancreatic cancer/obstruction, blunt abdominal trauma, hypertriglyceridemia (TG >1000), hypercalcemia, drugs (thiazides, protease inhibitors, azathioprine, 6MP), mumps, Coxsackie, vasculitis, pregnancy, genetic (PRSS1, SPINK1, CFTR), autoimmune (IgG4), scorpion venom Several scoring systems (all available on MDCalc) BISAP (Evaluate in first 24hours of presentation) Score 3 -5: mortality > 15 % APACHE II (Evaluate in first 24hours of ICU admission) Score> 8: mortality 11 \u2013 18 % Ranson (Evaluate at admission + 48hrs post admission) Score > 3: mortality > 15% (consider ICU admission) Glasgow-Imrie (modified Ranson criteria, used 48h post admission) Score >2 associated with higher mortality (consider ICU admission) Presentation Must have 2 out of the following 3 criteria: Pain characteristic of pancreatitis (sharp, epigastric, radiating to back) Enzymes (lipase or amylase) >3x ULN (ULN at VUMC = 78) ***Use lipase, much more specific than amylase Imaging characteristic of pancreatitis (US, CT, MRI) If pain is characteristic and lipase > 3xULN, no need for CT A/P (imaging only really useful if either of the 2 criteria above are equivocal) Grading Severity: Mild: no organ failure or systemic complications Moderate: transient organ failure (<48 hours) Severe: persistent organ failure (>48 hours) Evaluation Lipase, CBC, CMP, lipid panel, lactate, direct bilirubin Obtain RUQ U/S for all pts, evaluates for gallstones CT A/P w/ IV contrast if indicated Reserved for patients not improving at 48-72 hour to assess for complications If performed at onset, underestimates severity (necrosis takes 72 hours from onset) Management Fluids, Fluids, Fluids: Bolus 10 mg/kg (if clinically hypovolemic) + 1.5mL/kg/hr Maintenance Fluids Follow HCT and BUN as markers for successful fluid resuscitation Persistent hemoconcentration at 24 hr is associated with necrotizing pancreatitis Pain Control: Common starting narcotic regimen is oxycodone 10 mg q6h PRN and hydromorphone 0.5 mg q4h for breakthrough Nutrition: Do NOT have to make NPO at presentation, restarting enteral feeding as early as tolerated is recommended; addressing fluid resuscitation and pain control will help improve appetite and PO tolerance Start with clear liquid diet or mechanical soft and advance as tolerated Low fat diet (Fatty acids \u2191 CCK \u2191 trypsinogen to trypsin) If NPO > 72 hours, attempt PO and if fail, place Dobhoff for enteral nutrition at latest by day 5\u2026 outcomes with NG/NJ >>> TPN Antibiotics: Fever, leukocytosis common, not an indication for ABX as the necrosis is (often) sterile Infection of the necrosis should be suspected with failure to improve 7 days after onset CT A/P w/ IV contrast recommended to assess for pancreatic or extra-pancreatic necrosis or local complications Most likely organisms enteric (E. Coli, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus) If clinical signs of infection and abdominal imaging demonstrating gas within necrosis, can empirically start ABX without aspirate or culture Use abx with good pancreatic necrotic penetration: Cefepime/FQ + Flagyl or carbapenem EUS or IR guided drain for aspirate: can be done on immature collections for diagnostic purposes but typically only done if collection is walled-off\u2014at least 4 weeks Endoscopic Intervention (cystogastrostomy) has emerged as first-line therapy for symptomatic pseudocysts or walled-off pancreatic necrosis, with step-up therapy to video assisted retroperitoneal debridement (VARD) or surgery when needed Additional Information Urgent ERCP for choledocholithiasis on imaging, with cholangitis or obstructive jaundice, otherwise elective ERCP (see page on choledocholithiasis) Complications: ARDS, abdominal compartment syndrome, AKI, DIC < 4 weeks after pancreatitis: Peripancreatic fluid collection, acute necrotic collection 6 weeks after pancreatitis: pancreatic pseudocyst, walled-off necrosis (WON) Most fluid collections should be followed over time as acute collections can resolve and are unable to be sampled safely with EUS Gallstone pancreatitis: All pts should have cholecystectomy once recovered (recurrence is 25-30%) with EGS Performed during initial admission in cases of mild acute pancreatitis Consider age or co-morbid illness precludes fitness for surgery Chronic Pancreatitis Author: AJ De Witte Definition A syndrome characterized by irreversible chronic progressive pancreatic inflammation, fibrosis, and scarring, resulting in damage to and loss of exocrine (acinar), endocrine (islet cells), and ductal cells. Etiology: TIGAR-O mnemonic T oxic Metabolic: EtOH, tobacco use, hyperCa (Ca > 12), HLD (fasting TG > 300, nonfasting > 500), CKD 5, medications, toxins I diopathic: early onset (age < 35), late onset (age > 35) G enetic: Autosomal dominant (PRSS1 gene), recessive (CFTR, SPINK1, etc.) A utoimmune: IgG4-related (AIP type 1), AIP type 2 R ecurrent, severe acute pancreatitis O bstructive: pancreas divisum, ampullary stenosis, main duct pancreatic stones or strictures, widespread calcifications, mass causing duct obstruction Presentation Abdominal pain (most common) Exocrine insufficiency: diarrhea, steatorrhea, weight loss Typically occurs later in disease process Endocrine insufficiency: diabetes Occasionally asymptomatic Evaluation Imaging: CT or MRI (may be negative early in course of disease) If CT or MRI negative but suspicion for CP remains high, consider EUS +/- biopsy or secretin-enhanced MRCP Labs: - BMP, LFTs, lipid panel, PeTH - Consider genetic testing, especially in younger patients and/or patients without clear etiology - Pancreatic function testing diagnoses exocrine insufficiency but is not necessary for diagnosis of CP - Gold standard = 72 hour fecal fat (> 7g of fat per 100g stool per day) - rarely done - More practical = fecal elastase (<100 = diagnostic, 100-200 = indeterminate) - Must be performed on formed stool, can be false positive If watery specimen - Do not have to stop pancreatic enzymes to measure - Lipase and amylase levels can be elevated, but are usually normal due to pancreatic scarring and fibrosis Management Tobacco and EtOH cessation Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy if evidence/diagnosis of exocrine insufficiency Usual dose: 50,000 units/meal + 25,000 units with snacks Should take with first bite of a meal and consider adding extra enzymes or splitting up dose throughout meal if lasting longer than 15 mins If lack of response: try increasing dose, confirm compliance, add PPI, split up dose throughout meal, look for concurrent GI disorders Pain: Tylenol + NSAIDs > Opioids (Tramadol), consider SSRI/SNRI/TCA or gabapentin For refractory pain, other options include celiac plexus blockade or total pancreatectomy with islet auto transplant Vitamin supplementation + Vit D + Ca Consider antioxidants (selenium, ascorbic acid, \u03b2-carotene, and methionine, vitamin E) \u2013 mixed evidence but some studies have shown improved pain control Routine testing for osteoporosis and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies Anorectal Disease Author: Ashley Cozart Background Benign and malignant causes share symptoms, often hemorrhoidal complaints. Presentation Perianal pain Generalized: pruritis ani, less likely to be malignant Localized: skin trauma, perianal abscess, perianal neoplasms, external hemorrhoids Anal canal pain: anal fissure, anal cancer, anal ulceration (STIs), proctalgia fugax Bleeding: anal fissures, internal hemorrhoids, anal cancer Prolapsing tissue: prolapsing internal hemorrhoids, rectal prolapse Pruritis: most likely idiopathic, inflammatory skin disorders (dermatitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, SCC), infections (STIs and Candida), systemic diseases (usually generalized; DM, cholestasis, thyrotoxicosis, HIV, etc.) Perianal drainage: anal fistula, fecal incontinence, or other skin conditions (i.e. pilonidal cyst) Evaluation Visual inspection+ DRE + anoscopy/proctoscopy/colonoscopy Anoscopy: eval of anal condylomata, neoplasms, internal hemorrhoids, anal fissures Rigid proctoscopy: eval of rectal neoplasms, proctitis Colonoscopy: eval of anal bleeding Management Internal hemorrhoids: Low grade (I or II): Dietary: water intake + fiber supplements +/- stool softeners Lifestyle modifications: limiting seated and toilet time Rx: topical anesthetics + steroids (intermittent short-term use), vasoactive agents (Prep H, Nitro), antispasmodic agents (ie. Nifedipine), sitz baths. Refer to GI clinic or colorectal surgery clinic if refractory to 6-8 weeks of medical treatment High grade (III or IV): refer to colorectal surgeon If bleeding refractory to conservative management, refer for banding (colorectal surgery vs GI) External hemorrhoids: Thrombosed external hemorrhoids: <72 hours- bedside incision and thrombectomy 72 hours- operative intervention avoided since discomfort will likely improve. If nonviable skin on exam- urgent surgical intervention If not thrombosed, can treat like low grade internal hemorrhoids as stated above If rectal bleeding associated with any type of hemorrhoid, refer for colonoscopy Perianal abscess: consult surgery for urgent incision and drainage Anal fistula: surgery Anal fissure: treat w/ 1 mo of supportive measures (fiber, sitz bath, topical analgesic), topical vasodilator (nifedipine or nitroglycerin), and resolution of constipation. Surgery if refractory. Anal cancer: treatment based on tumor location/histology Rectal prolapse: Likely surgical repair (indications include sensation of rectal prolapse and fecal incontinence and associated constipation.

Common etiologies: opioid-induced, medications (anti-depressants, iron, anticholinergics) hypothyroidism, hypokalemia, pregnancy, IBS, neurogenic (trauma, MS, Parkinson disease, diabetes, autonomic dysregulation). Always think about risk of obstruction (prior abdominal surgeries, oncology history or risk for GI/GU malignancies, history of IBD/Crohn's). Evaluation Evaluate etiologies plus lifestyle factors (low fiber intake, low fluid intake, reduced mobility, acute illness) Clinical diagnosis, no need for imaging unless concerned for obstruction \u2192 KUB/ CT BMP + Mg to evaluate electrolytes, consider TSH if chronic Rectal exam to exclude rectal mass or fecal impaction (constipation + diarrhea doesn't exclude impaction/obstruction. Overflow around mass = encoparesis) Management Stop or minimize offending medications if possible Optimize lifestyle factors: out of bed, walking hallways, increase fluid intake, + cup of coffee if appropriate. Escalating pathway: ensure meds are scheduled not PRN MiraLAX (PEG) 17g BID (can give TID) + Senna nightly (can increase to BID and/or 2 tabs) \u2192 Bisacodyl suppository \u2192 enema (tap water or SMOG) \u2192 stronger osmotic laxative (lactulose 20mg once, Mag-citrate, Golytely) \u2192 escalate lactulose dosing 20 \u2013 30 mg q2hrs Other considerations: Avoid Fleet enemas (sodium-phosphate) in CKD and geriatric populations \"The hand that writes for opioids also writes a bowel regimen\" Generally, start with scheduled MiraLAX (PEG) 17g daily + senna nightly If severe and unrelieved by escalating therapies, can try methylnaltrexone Lactulose can cause severe bloating and cramping In patients unable to take PO: place DHT to deliver meds or rectal lactulose (important for patients with cirrhosis with AMS/HE). In patients with CF (at risk for distal intestinal obstruction syndrome): ensure have pancreatic enzymes ordered, managed more like constipation than true obstruction: PO/ NGT MiraLAX QID or Golytely. Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome): >12cm cecal diameter = severe dilation, risk of perforation. Treated with neostigmine, 2mg IV over 3 to 5 minutes. Monitor for bradycardia, hypotension, and dysrhythmias (relative contraindications: recent MI, asthma, PUD, epilepsy). Decompression with colonoscopy used in some cases. Consider pelvic floor dysfunction, pelvic floor PT may be helpful Laxatives Mechanism Examples Effects Bulking-agent Psyllium seed (Metamucil), methylcellulose (Citrucel) Absorb water and increase fecal bulk Osmotic Laxatives Polyethylene glycol (PEG = MiraLAX and Golytely), lactulose, mag-citrate Hyperosmotic substances, pull fluid into GI tract Stimulant Laxative Senna, Bisacodyl (Dulcolax) Stimulates peristalsis Stool Softener Docusate (Colace) Generally ineffective Opioid antagonist Methylnaltrexone (Reslistor) Peripheral acting opioid antagonist, inhibits opioid-induced decreased gastrointestinal motility cGMP Agonist Linaclotide (Linzess), Plecanatide (Trulance) Stimulates intestinal secretion of Cl-/HCO3- Prostaglandin derivative Lubiprostone (Amitiza) Increases intestinal chloride-rich fluid secretion Diarrhea Author: Charles Oertli Background 3 BM/day OR abnormally loose stool Acute (<2 weeks), persistent (2-4 weeks), or chronic (>4 weeks) 95% of acute diarrhea is self-limited & no additional treatment needed Most cases of acute diarrhea are due to infections Non-infectious etiologies become more common with increasing duration Voluminous watery diarrhea more likely disorder of small bowel Small volume frequent diarrhea more likely disorder of colon Nocturnal diarrhea suggests an inflammatory or secretory etiology Acute Diarrhea Etiology Watery diarrhea: viral gastroenteritis (norovirus, rotavirus, enteric adenovirus), C. diff, C. perfringens, S. Aureus, Bacillus cereus, enterotoxigenic E. coli, Cryptosporidium, Listeria, Cyclospora, vibrio cholerae, (Giardia is typically more chronic), Tropheryma whipplei, COVID Inflammatory diarrhea: Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, EHEC, Yersinia, E histolytica, invasive viruses (CMV, HSV), Non-cholera vibrio. Look for red flag symptoms (see below). Medications, specifically antibiotics Presentation Evaluate for red flags (BATS are Vulnerable vampires) B loody stools, A ntibiotics/Recent hospitalization Any antibiotic can cause C. diff; the longer the treatment, the more likely Most common to cause C. diff: Clindamycin > Penicillins/Cephalosporins/Fluoroquinolones T oo many stools: >6 unformed stools/day S epsis (Fever) or Severe abdominal pain Vulnerable (Age >70 yr, immunocompromised, IVDU, IBD, pregnant, travel) Evaluation All patients: CBC w/ diff and BMP to eval for leukocytosis (C.diff), AKI, electrolyte abnormalities, thrombocytopenia/anemia (HUS), eosinophilia (parasites) If red flag symptoms or diarrhea > 7d: ESR/CRP, C.diff, GIPP If immunocompromised: consider CMV, MAC, microsporidia If abdominal pain: consider CT A/P with IV contrast If concern for IBD or hx of IBD: CT Enterography with PO and IV contrast Blood Cultures if febrile/septic Management All patients: supportive care with PO or IVF, electrolyte repletion If C.diff negative or treatment for C.diff started, ok for symptomatic treatment with Loperamide Start with Loperamide 4mg x1 then transition to 2mg QID (AC+HS) (maximum 16mg/day) If fever or inflammatory symptoms and C.diff not back, ok for Bismuth sabsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) 30mL or 2 tablets q30min x8 Indications for antibiotics: GIPP negative for Shigella, 0157:H7 (can precipitate HUS) and salmonella (can prolong carrier state) Empiric antibiotic therapy ONLY if toxic appearance or high concern for progressive illness/decompensation Ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID or levofloxacin 500 mg daily x 3-5 days Azithromycin 500 mg daily x 3 days Ampicillin + gentamicin used for pregnant women to cover for Listeria C. diff positive (see section below) Approach to Chronic Diarrhea Causes of Watery Diarrhea Secretory Motility Osmotic Microscopic colitis Bile acid malabsorption Carcinoid Crohn's disease Gastrinoma VIPoma Mastocytosis Addison's disease Hyperthyroidism Diabetes Amyloidosis Systemic scleroderma Meds: macrolides, metoclopramide, bisacodyl, senna, pyridostigmine Lactose intolerance Bile salt diarrhea Sugar alcohols: sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol Meds: antibiotics, caffeine, colchicine, NSAIDs, antineoplastics, antiarrhythmics (digoxin), metformin, carbamazepine Meds: citrates, lactulose, magnesium-containing antacids, mycophenolate, antibiotics, propranolol, hydralazine, procainamide Functional: IBS Causes of Fatty Diarrhea (Steatorrhea) Malabsorption Inflammatory Celiac disease Gastric bypass Short bowel syndrome Tropical Sprue Whipple disease Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) Post-infectious malabsorptive diarrhea Maldigestion Pancreatic insufficiency Hepatobiliary disorders Diverticulitis Ischemic colitis Neoplasia Radiation colitis Arsenic poisoning Microscopic colitis Invasive infections: bacterial (tuberculosis, yersinosis), viral (CMV, HSV), Parasites (amebiasis, strongyloidiasis) Inflammatory bowel disease Evaluation Labs: CBC w/ diff, CMP, ESR/CRP, TSH, celiac serologies if high suspicion (anti-TTG) Spot fecal elastase Steatorrhea (greasy, malodorous stools that float) Colonoscopy indicated if alarm symptoms are present ( >45 yrs and hasn't had one, or <45 yrs and concern for IBD, CMV, ischemic colitis or microscopic colitis) If concern for IBS: Rome IV criteria (see section on \"IBS\" below) Management IBS: trial elimination diet/low FODMAP, antidiarrheals Pancreatic insufficiency: enzyme replacement (Creon), consult nutrition for assistance Celiac: eliminate gluten, will need outpatient nutrition follow-up Bile acid malabsorption: can try cholestyramine (can affect absorption of other meds) Dysphagia Author: Julie Anne Giannini Background Oropharyngeal dysphagia- difficulty initiating swallow, experiencing coughing, choking Esophageal dysphagia- difficulty swallowing several seconds after initiation Presentation Difficulty swallowing solids, liquids, or both? Solids only = mechanical Progressive symptoms: esophageal stricture, peptic stricture, or esophageal cancer Not progressive symptoms: eosinophilic esophagitis, esophageal rings or web, external compression (vascular abnormalities) Solids and Liquids = motility disorder Progressive symptoms: achalasia or systemic sclerosis Not progressive symptoms: esophageal hypercontractility or esophageal outflow obstruction Evaluation: Esophageal Dysphagia Upper endoscopy +/- biopsy if no previous history of esophageal abnormalities Normal upper endoscopy: Barium swallow for dysphagia to solids only if mechanical obstruction still suspected Esophageal manometry for dysphagia to solids and liquids or suspecting motility disorder Barium swallow if history of prior radiation, caustic injury, surgery, suspicion for proximal esophageal lesion (Zenker's) or complex stricture Do not order if food impaction suspected or imminent endoscopy Order as timed barium esophagram. If barium emptying is normal and tablet passes without issues, it rules out motility abnormality or stricture. Esophageal manometry helps assess intraluminal pressures, peristalsis, and bolus transit. Disorders of EGJ outflow: achalasia, EGJ outflow obstruction Disorder of Peristalsis: absent contractility, distal esophageal spasm, hypercontractile esophagus, ineffective esophageal motility Evaluation: Oropharyngeal Dysphagia Videofluoroscopic modified barium swallow and fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) Management Food impaction: IV glucagon to relax lower esophageal sphincter vs urgent upper endoscopy Odynophagia Author: Ahmed Samy Definition Pain with swallowing, often accompanied by dysphagia and retrosternal discomfort Etiology: PIECE mnemonic Pill-induced antibiotics (tetracyclines), NSAIDs, ART, K-Cl, bisphosphonates Diagnosis: clinical, but EGD may be warranted for persistent(> 1wk) or severe symptoms Rx: discontinue culprit med (or substitute with liquid formulation) and start PPI; Can do GI cocktail combination (maalox, benadryl, lidocaine) swish and swallow x 3 days. Prevention: take culprit meds w/ 8 oz water and sit upright for 30 mins after. Infectious: Candida esophagitis: HIV (CD4 < 100), heme malignancies, chemo, antibiotics, steroids Can exist without OP thrush Diagnosis: consider empiric fluconazole trial (improvement by 3-5 days). If refractory, EGD, biopsy, culture Treatment: fluconazole 400mg PO/IV day 1, then 200-400mg daily x 14-21 days. HSV esophagitis: immunocompromised including transplant recipients Diagnosis: well-circumscribed \"volcano-like\" ulcers on EGD, biopsy or brushings of ulcer edge; absence of herpes labialis or oropharyngeal ulcers should not preclude diagnosis Rx: acyclovir 400mg PO five times daily x14-21 days (immunocompromised) acyclovir 200mg PO five times daily or 400mg PO tid x 7-10 days (immunocompetent) CMV esophagitis: HIV (CD4 < 50 ) Diagnosis: EGD-linear/longitudinal ulcers + confirmed pathology. Generally, PCR/viral load not helpful but negative serology may lower suspicion Rx: begin treatment while path is pending- ganciclovir 5mg/kg IV q12h vs foscarnet (if leukopenia, low plts). Change to PO once able to tolerate- valganciclovir 900mg BIDx 3-6weeks. Confirmed CMV esophagitis warrants optho eval for CMV retinitis Eosinophilic esophagitis (see section) Caustic alkali or acid-induced injury (household cleaners, batteries, pool cleaners). Evaluation: ABCs, including fluid resuscitation and intubation if needed. Rule out life-threatening perforation based on exam (mediastinitis, peritonitis), end organ damage (CBC, CMP, lactate, UDS), and imaging (CT-chest/abdomen w/contrast showing transmural necrosis). NPO until evaluation is complete to determine the grade of injury Avoid attempting to reverse ingestion with emetics or neutralizing agents via NG tube Stress ulcer ppx w/ PPI. Conflicting evidence for steroids. EGS consult (preemptively start broad abx) if workup is suggestive of urgent intervention. Otherwise, EGD < 24hrs of ingestion to further grade injury Lower-grade injury: start on liquid and advance to regular diet over 24-48 hours. Higher-grade injury: needs ICU-level monitoring; start PO intake at 48 hrs, based on tolerability (liquids vs enteral vs TPN) Additional information: Subsequent EGD monitoring q2-3 years recommended to monitor for complications (esophageal stricture, SCC) Ingestion is often intentional, consider psych eval if appropriate GERD (see section) Gastroparesis Author: Hashim Hayat Background Syndrome of objectively delayed gastric emptying in absence of mechanical obstruction Etiology: Diabetes (most common), post-surgical (gastric or bariatric surgery), thyroid dysfunction, autoimmune or neurologic disorders, medication-induced (GLP-1 agonists, narcotics, anticholinergic agents Presentation Nausea, vomiting (may contain food eaten several hours prior), abdominal pain (dull, crampy; rarely a predominant symptom), early satiety, postprandial fullness, bloating, weight loss in severe cases Evaluation Exclude mechanical obstruction and mucosal disease with CTE and EGD Scintigraphic gastric emptying study = gold standard for diagnosis (measures gastric retention of solids at 4h) Stop medications that may affect gastric emptying 48 hrs prior to testing Must have blood sugar < 275 (Hyperglycemia delays gastric emptying) Management Support with IVF and electrolytes \u2013 PO intake preferred Glycemic control in diabetics Stop offending medications Nutrition consult for teaching on frequent small volume meals that are low in fat and soluble fiber If continued symptoms after above, try prokinetics and antiemetics Prokinetics Liquid formulations preferred for better absorption Give 15min before meals and at bedtime. First line is Reglan. If no response, try Domperidone and subsequently erythromycin (not good for long term, pts develop tachyphylaxis) Antiemetics: helps symptoms but do not improve gastric emptying In severe cases patients may require enteral feeding (post pyloric preferred) or venting g-tube Emerging endoscopic treatment options: G-POEM (gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy) GERD Author: Lindsey Creech Background Reflux of stomach contents causing symptoms and/or endoscopic complications Severity classified based on appearance of esophageal mucosa on EGD and frequency of symptoms. Erosive esophagitis: endoscopically visible breaks in distal esophageal mucosa + GERD Nonerosive reflux disease: presence of symptoms of GERD without esophageal mucosal injury and positive pH testing Presentation Esophageal symptoms: heartburn, regurgitation, chest pain, dysphagia, globus sensation, odynophagia Extra-esophageal symptoms: chronic cough, hoarseness, asthma, chest pain, dental erosions, globus sensation Complications: Esophageal stricture, Barrett's esophagus, esophageal adenocarcinoma Evaluation Clinical diagnosis with classic heartburn and/or regurgitation If dx uncertain, can perform ambulatory pH monitoring EGD indicated for the following: Presence of alarm features (dysphagia, persistent vomiting, GI cancer in 1\u00ba relative, odynophagia, GI bleeding, weight loss, iron deficiency anemia, age \u2265 60 y/o with new-onset GERD symptoms) Risk factors for Barrett's esophagus (duration of GERD at least 5-10 years [must be present], >50 yo, male, white, hiatal hernia, obesity, nocturnal reflux, tobacco use, first-degree relative w/ Barrett's and/or adenocarcinoma) Abnormal UGI tract imaging (i.e. luminal abnormalities) Continued symptoms despite adequate PPI therapy Management First and foremost, Lifestyle and dietary modifications: Weight loss, elevate HOB, avoid large meals or meals within 3 hrs of bedtime, elimination/minimization of chocolate, caffeine, spicy foods, citrus, and carbonated beverages Mild/intermittent symptoms (2x/wk) w/o erosive esophagitis (if had EGD): Trial H2RA (famotidine 10mg) PRN; reassess in 4 wks If persistent sx, increase H2RA BID (famotidine 20mg); reassess in 2 wks. If sx improve, step-down therapy as tolerated If persistent sx on H2RA BID, then PPI qd (omeprazole 10mg), increase to omeprazole 20mg if remaining uncontrolled; reassess in 4-8 wks If sx improve, discontinue PPI If persistent sx, manage as refractory and refer to GI for EGD +/- ambulatory pH testing Frequent symptoms (>2 episodes/wk, and/or severe symptoms that impair QOL): PPI qd (omeprazole 20mg) for 8 wks, if sx improvement, discontinue PPI Recurrent symptoms: 2/3 of patients w/ nonerosive reflux disease relapse when acid suppression is discontinued If \u22653 months after discontinuing, repeat 8-wk course of PPI If <3 months of discontinuing, EGD (if not already performed) to rule out other etiologies or complications Erosive esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus: Require maintenance acid suppression with a standard dose PPI (omeprazole 20mg) daily given likelihood of recurrent symptoms and complications if stopped PPI use: Should be prescribed at lowest dose and for shortest duration appropriate Most effective if taken 30-60min before first meal of the day Taper if taking >6 mo, then transition to H2RA PRN for mild or intermittent sx Long term side effects: Very well tolerated, high-quality RCTs show slightly higher risk of enteric infections (such as C.diff) If pregnant patient, start with antacids or sucralfate If elderly patient, attempt to wean off PPI/H2RA or discontinue with goal of using antacid PRN (due to side effects of H2RA and PPI) Eosinophilic Esophagitis Author: Wrinn Alexander Background Association with atopy (asthma, allergies, eczema, rhinitis) Dysphagia (most commonly to solid foods), food impaction, central chest pain, GERD/refractory heartburn, upper abdominal pain Clinical presentation may vary based on age: Children < 4 years often have feeding concerns and growth issues Children 4-11 years often have frequent regurgitation, abdominal pain, and vomiting Adolescents & adults may present with food impactions, dysphagia, and chest pain Evaluation Diagnostic criteria Symptoms related to esophageal dysfunction EGD with >15 eos/hpf on biopsy Exclusion of other causes for esophageal eosinophilia 50-60% pts will have elevated serum IgE lvl; peripheral eosinophilia can be seen but is generally mild Management Management depends on patient's preference Elimination diet: 1FED (animal milk; most common), 2FED (milk and wheat), 6FED (milk, egg, wheat, soy, fish and nut) Standard dose PPI for 8 weeks \u00b1 elimination diet. If still symptomatic after 4 weeks, increase PPI to BID. Use lowest PPI dose that maintains symptom remission Alternative treatment is oral budesonide suspension 2mg twice daily x12 weeks or fluticasone propionate (18+ yo: >220 mcg/spray, four sprays daily in divided doses; 12-17yo: 220mcg/spray, eight sprays daily in divided doses; 1-11yo: 110 mcg/spray, eight sprays daily in divided doses) After the above trials, repeat EGD in 8-12 weeks to assess response. If on stricter elimination diets than 1FED, can reintroduce food groups and repeat assessment May require intermittent dilation of strictures to relieve dysphagia Evaluation by an allergist is recommended given strong association with allergies Dupilumab and Eohilia are alternative treatment options and are the only FDA-approved agents for EoE Complications: food impactions, post-endoscopic tears, esophageal rupture (rare) ACG 2025 Guidelines on EoE: https://gi.org/journals-publications/ebgi/eluri_feb2025/ ACG 2025 Podcast on EoE: https://education.gi.org/podcasts/podcast_207 Peptic Ulcer Disease Author: Kinsley Ojukwu Background Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) occurs when there is a break (ulceration) in the lining of the stomach or duodenum. Ulcer is >5mm break in the mucosa, with extension through muscularis mucosa or deeper layers. Erosion is <5mm. Etiology H-Pylori infection > NSAID use >>> ZES associated gastrinoma Other associated factors: smoking, EtOH, acute stress, malignancy, and glucocorticoids in combination with NSAIDs Presentation Episodic aching, gnawing, or burning epigastric pain; N/V, heartburn alleviated by antiacids. Gastric ulcers (pain worse w/eating, weight loss); duodenal ulcers (pain better w/eating, worse on empty stomach, worse at night) May be asymptomatic until complications such as hemorrhage or perforation Alarm features: unintentional weight loss, persistent vomiting, melena, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, progressive dysphagia, early satiety, palpable abdominal mass, left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy (Virchow node) Evaluation EGD for complicated PUD, patients with alarm sx, or dyspepsia w/ age >60 CBC, H Pylori testing if no strong NSAID use H. Pylori endoscopic tests (biopsy urease, histology, culture) H. Pylori non-endoscopic tests (Serology \u2013 IgG, Urea Breath test, stool antigen) Most H. Pylori tests affected by PPI and/or antibiotic use; stop PPI 1-2 weeks prior to testing; serology testing is not useful post treatment. Management General: treat underlying cause, encourage smoking cessation, limit ETOH, stop NSAIDs Uncomplicated peptic ulcer (non H. pylori) Oral PPI (e.g., omeprazole 20 to 40 mg daily) x 4 weeks (duodenal ulcers) or 8 weeks (gastric ulcers) Uncomplicated peptic ulcer and + H. Pylori Oral PPI BID x14 days with combination antibiotic regimen Macrolide exposure/resistance: Bismuth Quadruple Therapy No Macrolide exposure/resistance: Clarithromycin Triple Therapy (Amoxicillin) FYI: There is an order set for H pylori regimen in EPIC at VUMC Confirm H. pylori eradication (via stool antigen test, urease breath test, or EGD >4 weeks after completion of therapy. If not eradicated, re-treat: Clarithromycin Triple Therapy -> Bismuth Quadruple Therapy Bismuth Quadruple Therapy -> Levofloxacin Triple Therapy Complicated peptic ulcer (bleeding, perforation, gastric outlet obstruction) Gastric or duodenal ulcer perforation is a surgical emergency; will clinically present as peritonitis, but may be subtle in older/immunocompromised pts Fluid resuscitation, NG decompression, acid suppression, empiric antibiotic therapy, EGS consult EGD is indicated to determine etiology and for possible treatment, however surgery is often indicated. IV PPI (if bleeding: IV PPI for 72 hrs after endoscopic treatment, then oral PPI) Additional Information Continue maintenance PPI therapy (omeprazole 20 mg daily) for the following: Peptic ulcer >2 cm and age >50 or multiple co-morbidities Frequently recurrent peptic ulcers (>2 in one year) H. pylori-negative, NSAID-negative ulcer disease Failure to eradicate H. pylori (including salvage therapy) Condition requiring long term aspirin/NSAID use Persistent ulcer on repeat EGD (if performed) Indications for repeat EGD (8-12 weeks): Persistent/recurrent symptoms despite medical therapy Complicated ulcer (bleeding), with evidence of ongoing bleeding Giant gastric ulcer (>2 cm) or features of malignancy at initial endoscopy Gastric ulcer that was not biopsied or inadequately sampled on initial EGD Gastric ulcer in pt w/risk factors for gastric cancer (>50 yo, H. pylori, immigrant from high prevalence area [Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Costa Rica], FHx, presence of gastric atrophy, adenoma, dysplasia, intestinal metaplasia) In refractory dyspepsia, consider alternative etiologies: malignancy, infection (CMV), Crohn's, eosinophilic gastroenteritis \u2013 all can mimic PUD and present as ulcers in the stomach and duodenum GI Bleeding Author: Alex DeWeerd Background Intraluminal blood loss anywhere from the nasopharynx/oral cavity to the anus Don't forget epistaxis or oropharyngeal bleeding as possible source of melena IV PPI prior to endoscopy may \u2193 need for endoscopic therapy but does not impact transfusion requirement, rebleeding risk, need for surgical intervention, or mortality Classification: relative location to the Ligament of Treitz (LoT) Upper = proximal to LoT PUD, gastritis (alcohol, stress, NSAIDs, ASA), esophagitis, variceal bleed, Mallory-Weiss tear, AVM, Dieulafoy's lesion, aorto-enteric fistula, gastric antral vascular ectasias, malignancy Lower = distal to LoT Diverticular bleed, ischemic/infectious/IBD/radiation colitis, malignancy, angiodysplasia, anorectal (hemorrhoids, anal fissure), Meckel's diverticulum, post-polypectomy bleed Historical factors to consider when trying to identify source of bleeding Cirrhosis or chronic alcohol use: varices or portal hypertensive gastropathy Hx of AAA or aortic graft: aorto-enteric fistula Hx of renal disease, aortic stenosis, HHT: angiodysplasia Hx of H. pylori, NSAID use, tobacco use: PUD Hx of tobacco use, H. pylori, weight loss, early satiety, dysphagia, change in bowel habits: malignancy Painless hematochezia: diverticular bleed Abdominal pain: colitis Look out for false positives: bismuth, charcoal, licorice, and iron Presentation Hematemesis (very specific for upper GI bleed), hematochezia (usually lower although brisk upper possible), melena (usually upper), coffee-ground emesis, epigastric/abdominal pain, acute or chronic, hx of GI bleed and prior endoscopies. Exam: VITALS \u2013 assess hemodynamic stability to determine resuscitation needs, MICU vs. floor; orthostatic vs, rectal exam every time (smear stool on white tissue paper to look for melena), look for signs of cirrhosis (jaundice, palmar erythema, ascites, spider angiomata) Vital signs that may help estimate severity of bleed: Blood loss <15% - resting tachycardia Blood loss 15-40% - orthostatic hypotension Blood loss >40% - supine hypotension Evaluation CBC, PT/INR, CMP, Lactic Acid, Blood Gas BUN/Crt ratio > 30:1 more predictive of upper GI bleed, <20:1 more predictive of lower GI bleed EGD: usually best Difficulty localizing GIB: pill-capsule, balloon enteroscopy Meckel's scan, tagged RBC scan Massive lower GI bleeds will require arteriography Management Secure airway (intubation) if comatose, extremely combative, or massive hematemesis At least 2 large bore IV's (> 18 gauge) \u2013 ask nurses directly to ensure these are placed Maintain active type and screen Bolus IVF to maintain MAP >65H/H monitoring q6-q12 hours; transfusions as indicated Active bleeding: Start IV PPI (pantoprazole) 40 mg BID if thought to be upper/possible ulcer. If no active bleeding, can start IV PPI 40mg qd If cirrhotic, Ceftriaxone 1g daily for empiric SBP prophylaxis If possibility of variceal bleed: Octreotide IV 50 mcg x1 then 50 mcg/hr drip x 3-5 days NPO if unstable vs. clear liquids (no reds or purples) until morning for EGD Balloon tamponade can be temporizing measure for uncontrolled hemorrhage 2/2 EV (needs to be intubated if device is placed) For massive lower GI bleed: If hemodynamically unstable, consult IR and get a CTA abd/pelvis while doing fluid and blood product resuscitation. If hemodynamically stable, start with upper endoscopy to rule out UGIB. If source not identified on EGD, get CT angiography (if actively bleeding) or colonoscopy (if severe bleeding has stopped). If source not identified, investigate for small bowel bleed. Never give prep to a patient for colonoscopy (GoLytely) without discussing with GI fellow Consult gastroenterology to facilitate endoscopy. Consider consulting hematology if emergent anticoagulant reversal agent is needed. If endoscopy is unable to stop bleeding -> IR is next who can embolize If embolization fails -> EGS for source removal Ileus Author: Julie Giannini Background Non-mechanical decrease or stoppage of flow of intestinal contents. Result of a neuroimmune interaction that consists of the early neurogenic phase (autonomic nervous system) and the inflammatory phase (immune system). Risk factors: critically ill patients, s/p abdominal or retroperitoneal surgery, or perioperative complications (pneumonia or abscess). Other risk factors: opioid use, intra-abdominal inflammation/infection, bleeding, hypokalemia, and delayed enteral nutrition. Presentation Abdominal distention, bloating, N/V, inability to pass flatus, sparse/absent bowel sounds, often with slower onset than seen in a mechanical bowel obstruction Pain is often diffuse, persistent, and w/o peritoneal signs Evaluation Plain abdominal films: supine and upright films may show dilated small bowel loops, air in the colon and rectum w/o a transition point. If plain films are not diagnostic, CT w/ oral/IV contrast to help identify presence of transition point BMP Management Treating the underlying cause, bowel rest, IV fluids, +/- NG decompression, decrease opioids, ambulation Small bowel follow-through with gastrografin or water-soluble contrast does not help ileus Inflammatory Bowel Disease Authors: Emily Poellinger, Krissie Lobon Background Ulcerative colitis (UC): colon only (can have backwash ileitis) and almost always involves the rectum; contiguous lesions; mucosal inflammation Crohn's disease (CD): any part of the GI tract; \"skip lesions\"; transmural inflammation Important historical considerations to include in your documentation and presentation: Location of disease (CD: LB/SB, LB only, SB only; UC: proctitis, left-sided or pancolitis) Complications: Fistulas, sinus tracts, strictures, perianal disease, microperforation (more commonly in CD) Include previous endoscopy and imaging findings; current and prior IBD treatment and reason for transition (SEs, failure), primary IBD provider Genetics and Epidemiology First-degree relatives of people with IBD are 20x more likely to be diagnosed with the condition; however, only 15% of patients with IBD have a first-degree relative with the disease Genetic predisposition: CD > UC The number of individuals affected by IBD across the globe has increased from 3.7 mil (1990) to 6.8 mil (2017) Age of onset 15-30, though can present at any age. A bimodal age distribution with second peak between 50-80 is also seen Smoking is a risk factor for CD and increases risk of complications of CD. Does not increase risk for UC. Presentation UC: frequent diarrhea (often bloody), tenesmus, urgency, abdominal pain; may have fever, malaise, symptomatic anemia, and weight loss Complications: severe bleeding/anemia, fulminant colitis, toxic megacolon, perforation, colorectal cancer CD: abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, fever, malaise, weight loss; May also have diarrhea (\u00b1 bloody depending on CD location) Complications: fistulas (entero-enteric, entero-vesicular, entero-cutaneous, rectovaginal, perianal, retroperitoneal), abscesses, strictures, obstruction Small bowel involvement (>100 cm of terminal ileum) can lead to fat malabsorption 2/2 impaired enterohepatic circulation of bile salts Extra-intestinal (EI): arthritis, sacro-iliitis, uveitis, episcleritis, aphthous ulcers, erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, PSC (esp. UC), nephrolithiasis (calcium oxalate), thromboembolism, metabolic bone disease Disease severity (mild, moderate, severe) can be objectively measured using different indices, for example the Montreal classification of severity of UC is one such index that stratifies UC and CD. Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is also used as a grading system to describe disease activity. The frequency and severity of diarrhea, systemic symptoms, and lab abnormalities are also considerations of classification of IBD. Ulcerative Colitis Crohn's Disease Site Colon only, can have ileitis Any part of the GI tract Distribution Diffusely throughout colon; mucosa and submucosa inflammation only Focal, \"skip lesions\", transmural inflammation Histology Crypt abscess Non-caseating granulomas Complications Toxic megacolon, colorectal cancer Fistulas, strictures, abscesses, obstruction Perianal disease Rare Common Extraintestinal Manifestations Common Common Evaluation CBC w/diff, CMP, CRP, ESR, \u00b1 CMV PCR If diarrhea: rule out infection with GI Pathogen panel and C. diff, consider stool cultures, O&P, CMV PCR If anemic: obtain iron studies and type & screen If weight loss or concern for malnutrition: albumin, pre-albumin, Vitamin D, B12, folate Imaging: CT Enterography (oral contrast) preferred in CD, for luminal/extra-luminal complications How to order CTE: \"CT abdomen pelvis enterography\", order barium (Volumen) 0.1% oral suspension x2, 1st dose to be given by nurse 60 min before study, 2nd study to be given 30 min before (nurse should be in contact with CT tech) Endoscopy: If CD, will depend on the situation, but if acute severe UC, patient will need flex sig/colonoscopy asap (can be unprepped) Management Acute Flare Check for infectious etiology for acute flare: Send stool for C.diff and GI pathogen panel Pain control: usually a major component of hospital course Avoid NSAIDs, oral pain medications are preferred If pain is difficult to control, consider Acute Pain Service consult Narcotics and Imodium are contraindicated in toxic megacolon Antibiotics: appropriately treat infections (intra-abdominal or perianal abscess) with antibiotics (consider prior culture data, often use cipro/flagyl), but empiric antibiotics not routinely recommended otherwise VTE Prophylaxis: All IBD patients, even if having blood in stool (unless requiring transfusion) as they are at much higher risk of VTE Nutrition: Nutrition consult for all IBD patients; For severe malnutrition or if prolonged bowel rest is needed, TPN is sometimes initiated Anemia: Ferritin <100 or iron sat <20 with ferritin <300, consider iron infusions (if no bacteremia) or transfuse for severe anemia Smoking Cessation (esp. with CD): discuss smoking cessation & consult tobacco cessation Consult Colorectal Surgery (not EGS): SBO, toxic megacolon, bowel perforation, peritonitis, fistulizing disease Ensure consideration of other causes of colitis as above evaluation suggests (infectious, vascular, drug-induced) Immunosuppression: (Infections must be ruled out and/or treated before starting) Steroids: IV methylprednisolone (solumedrol) 30 mg BID or hydrocortisone 100 mg TID/QID for 3-5 days If multiple days without improvement, IBD providers will often consider initiation of biologics/immunomodulators Budesonide (Entocort): non-systemic steroid released during intestinal transit Transition to oral (40 mg prednisone daily) once clinically improved/tolerating PO; typically prescribe a prolonged taper on discharge (often down by 5 mg every week) If severe proctitis: consider rectal steroids (hydrocortisone enema/foam) If lack of response to steroids: rescue therapy with advanced therapies (Infliximab, Cyclosporine, JAK) or surgical intervention (colectomy for UC) Infliximab (Inflectra) is available at VUMC If patient fails to respond to steroids, consider possibility of CMV colitis (usually evaluated by biopsy on flex sig or colonoscopy), serum CMV PCR is part of initial workup but if negative it does not rule out CMV colitis Prior to initiating a biologic, all patients must have the following negative studies within the last year: Quantiferon Gold and CXR, Hepatitis B serologies, HIV, urine histoplasma Ag (some providers) Colon cancer screening: IBD that involves at least 1/3 of the colon (UC or CD) is associated with increased colon cancer. Usually not doing CRC screening as an inpatient but important consideration for outpatient care Induction and Maintenance Therapies for Remission Mild-Moderate UC: Induction of Remission: Multiple agents approved \u2013 advanced therapies preferred for mild/moderate disease. PO budesonide MMX, PO steroids, anti-TNF (adalimumab, golimumab, infliximab), Anti-integrin (Vedolizumab), IL 12/23 (Ustekinumab), IL-12 (Risankizumab, mirikizumab, guselkumab), JAK inhibitors (tofacinitib, upadacinitib), S1P (ozanimod, etrazimod). Avoid monotherapy with thiopurines or methotrexate When infliximab is used for induction often best to pursue combination induction with thiopurine like azathioprine Maintenance Therapy: If remission achieved with advanced therapy, continue for maintenance Corticosteroids are not used for maintenance therapy. The goal is steroid free remission Moderate-Severe UC: Induction of Remission: multiple agents approved \u2013 advanced therapies are preferred for moderate to severe disease. Anti-TNF (adalimumab, infliximab, certolizumab pegol) \u00b1 immunomodulator (azathioprine, 6-MP, methotrexate) to prevent antibody development; anti-IL 12/23 (Ustekinumab), anti-IL23 (Risankiaumb, mirikizumab, guselkumab), anti-integrin antibodies (vedolizumab, natalizumab), JAK inhibitor (Upadacitinib) PO steroids for short term use to alleviate symptoms during induction Maintenance Therapy: typically use the same medication used to achieve induction for maintenance and decision to discontinue immunomodulator is individualized based on disease history/complications but often it is discontinued after 12-24 months specifically for younger males, patients >60, or patients with history of recurrent nonmelanoma skin cancer Intestinal Ischemia Author: Ashley Ciosek Acute Mesenteric Ischemia Presentation Early: Abdominal pain is most common symptom, abdominal distension (\"pain out of proportion to exam\", meaning pain develops before abd tenderness) Late: As transmural bowel infarction develops, abdomen becomes distended, bowel sounds become absent, and peritoneal signs develop Arterial occlusion: Sudden onset, severe periumbilical pain, nausea and emesis Venous thrombosis: More insidious onset abdominal pain, waxing and waning Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia: variable location and severity of abdominal pain; often overshadowed by a precipitating disorder Pathophysiology Sudden onset \u2193 or absence of blood flow to the small intestines Mesenteric arterial occlusion: Arterial embolism: Associated with cardiac arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation), valvular disease, endocarditis, ventricular aneurysm, aortic atherosclerosis, and aortic aneurysm Arterial thrombosis: Most commonly from atherosclerotic disease; can also be 2/2 abdominal trauma, infection, or dissection Venous thrombosis: Associated w/ hypercoagulable states, malignancy, prior abdominal surgery, abdominal mass \u2192 venous compression, intra-abdominal inflammatory processes Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia: Intestinal hypoperfusion and vasoconstriction; associated with decreased cardiac output, sepsis, vasopressor use Evaluation Type and Screen, Lactic acid, BMP, CBC Imaging: KUB: Normal in > 25% of cases Ileus w/ distended bowel loops, bowel wall thickening, \u00b1 pneumatosis intestinalis (bowel wall air) Free intraperitoneal air \u2192 immediate abdominal ex-lap CT Angiography: no oral contrast, obscures mesenteric vessels, \u2193 bowel wall enhancement Focal or segmental bowel wall thickening, intestinal pneumatosis, portal vein gas, porto-mesenteric thrombosis, mesenteric arterial calcification, mesenteric artery occlusion Management General: IVFs, NPO, hemodynamic monitoring and support (try to avoid vasoconstricting agents), anticoagulation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, pain control If develops peritonitis or evidence of perforation on CT \u2192 EGS consult for surgery Mesenteric arterial embolism: Embolectomy vs. local infusion of thrombolytic agent Mesenteric arterial thrombosis: Surgical revascularization vs. thrombolysis with endovascular angioplasty and stenting Venous thrombosis: Anticoagulation; possible thrombolysis if persistent symptoms Non-occlusive disease: Treat underlying cause, stop vasoconstriction meds, consider intra-arterial vasodilator infusion Acute Mesenteric Ischemia Ischemic Colitis Abd pain early on, then abd tenderness later (\"pain out of proportion\") Abd tenderness > abd pain Acute illness, afib, endocarditis 90% patients are >60 y/o BRBPR less common overall (>24 hrs after pain starts) BRBPR onset <24 hrs into pain episode Dx: CT angio abd Dx: colonoscopy Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia Background \u2193 blood flow to intestines, typically caused by atherosclerosis of mesenteric vessel; risk factors include smoking, diabetes, sedentary lifestyle, age Also known as intestinal angina High-grade mesenteric vascular stenoses in at least two major vessels (celiac, SMA, or IMA) must be established Presentation Recurrent dull, crampy, postprandial (<60min to onset) abdominal pain Pts develop food aversion and often have associated weight loss Evaluation CTA abdomen/pelvis is preferred (>90% sensitivity and specificity) Can also consider duplex U/S (NPV ~99%), though less helpful if large habitus or prior abd surgery Management Conservative management if asymptomatic: smoking cessation and secondary prevention to limit progression of atherosclerotic disease Nutritional evaluation Revascularization (open vs. endovascular) is indicated if symptoms are present Mesenteric angioplasty and stenting is first-line therapy Open revascularization preferred in younger pts and those w/ re-stenosis Goal is to prevent future bowel infarction Ischemic Colitis Background Sudden, transient reduction in blood flow to colon Typically at \"watershed\" regions of colon, such as the splenic flexure and rectosigmoid junction Most often nonocclusive (95% of cases) and affects older adults Risk factors: ACS, hemodialysis, shock, aortoiliac instrumentation, cardiopulmonary bypass, extreme exercise (marathon running) Presentation Rapid onset, mild cramping abdominal pain, associated with urge to defecate, hematochezia Hematochezia is more commonly indicative of colonic (rather than small bowel) ischemia Tenderness present (typically over left side) Evaluation Lactic acid (nonspecific but elevated), LDH, CPK, CBC (leukocytosis), BMP (metabolic acidosis) KUB CT A/P with IV contrast (and oral contrast if patient can tolerate) Consider CTA A/P if suspicion for vascular occlusion Colonoscopy confirms diagnosis. Edematous, friable mucosa; erythema; and interspersed pale areas; bluish hemorrhagic nodules representing submucosal bleeding Segmental distribution, abrupt transition between injured and non-injured mucosa Management General: IVFs, bowel rest, antibiotics (Zosyn vs. CTX/Flagyl) Ischemic Colitis Management Classification Management Mild - No risk factors* Supportive care and observation Antibiotics can be stopped if no ulceration Moderate - 1-3 risk factors Same as mild ischemia if no vascular occlusion Systemic anticoagulation +/- vascular intervention if mesenteric occlusion Severe - > 3 risk factors, peritoneal signs, pneumatosis, pneumoperitoneum, gangrene or pancolonic ischemia on colonoscopy Consult EGS for abdominal exploration and segmental resection *Risk factors: male, SBP <90, HR >100, WBC>15k, Hgb <12, Na <136, BUN >20, LDH >350, isolated right-sided colonic involvement, abdominal pain with rectal bleeding Irritable Bowel Syndrome Author: Kathryn Welp Background Diagnose by the Rome IV criteria, no longer a diagnosis of exclusion Recurrent abdominal pain on average at least 1 day/week in the last 3 months with an onset at least 6 months prior, associated with two or more of the following criteria Pain related to defecation Change in frequency of stool Change in form (appearance) of stool Patient has none of the following warning signs: >50yrs, evidence of GIB, nocturnal pain or BMs, unintentional weight loss, family hx of colorectal cancer or IBD, palpable abdominal mass or LAD, IDA, +FOBT Classified based on predominant bowel habits Diarrhea: >25% BMs with Bristol stool types 6 or 7 Constipation: >25% BMs with Bristol stool types 1 or 2 Mixed: both of above Evaluation Thorough H&P for alarm symptoms as above Consider limited testing with CBC, CMP, CRP, celiac serology (TTG, anti-gliadin, etc), fecal calprotectin Management (1) Lifestyle/Dietary Modifications: Increased physical activity, low FODMAP diet (I: Eliminate high FODMAP foods for 4-6 wks, II: Incorporate foods back into diet and see what's tolerable) No evidence for probiotics (can potentially worsen bloating 2/2 SIBO) (2) Psychosocial Treatment: CBT, psychotherapy, therapeutic physician-patient relationship (3) Pharmacologic Treatment: Pain: colicky abdominal pain, avoid opioids Peppermint oil (smooth muscle relaxant) \u2013 IBGuard, Iberogast Antispasmodics: Hyosciamine acts faster than Dicyclomine TCAs (slow GI transit): Amitriptyline or nortriptyline (causes less constipation so better in IBS-C) Diarrhea: Ondansetron (8mg TID), Loperamide (up to 16g qd), Rifaximin (550mg BID for 2 wks), Eluxadoline (75-100mg BID); consider Lomotil if refractory Constipation: Fiber (Ispaghula husk orange), Miralax, Linzess (first line but can be expensive), Trulance, or Amitiza Other: SSRIs, SNRIs for concomitant mood disorders Gabapentin, Lyrica Large Bowel Obstruction Author: Kathryn Welp Background Mostly occurs distal to the transverse colon due to decreased colonic lumen diameter. 60% due to colon cancer, often the initial presenting symptom. Ddx: SBO, toxic megacolon, Ogilvie's syndrome, paralytic ileus, ischemic colitis Etiology Malignancy Benign Volvulus (cecal, sigmoid) Strictures (associated with diverticular disease, IBD, prior colorectal resection) Fecal impaction Less common: adhesions, hernia Presentation Bloating, infraumbilical crampy abdominal pain, and obstipation Focal tenderness or peritoneal signs is concerning for ischemia N/V can occur with proximal obstructions or in incompetent ileocecal valve In subacute cases: change in bowel patterns over time Evaluation: CBC w/ diff, BMP, CEA (if imaging concerning for malignancy) Abdominal CT: >90% sensitivity and specificity for detecting LBO. Demonstrates dilated colon proximal to a transition point with collapsed distal colon. 3-6-9 rule (describes normal bowel diameter): small bowel <3 cm, large bowel <6 cm, cecum <9 cm Abdominal XR: nonspecific with poor sensitivity. Management Oral bowel prep contraindicated. Initial supportive care: bowel rest, electrolyte correction, IVF, and gastric decompression. Unstable: peritoneal signs, closed-loop obstructions \u2192 emergency surgery Stable: Endoscopic stenting (more commonly for L-sided obstructions) Malignant obstructions require surgery for definitive management Volvulus: Cecal \u2192 surgery Sigmoid \u2192 endoscopic detorsion before semi-elective surgery (unless unstable) Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO) Author: Alex Wiles Background Risk Factors: prior abdominal surgeries (adhesions), malignancy, hernia, intestinal inflammation (IBD)/stricture, radiation, abscess, foreign bodies Indicators for bowel ischemia: fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, peritonitis Ddx: early appendicitis, large bowel obstruction, Ogilvie's, DKA, Pancreatitis, IBD, Gastric outlet obstruction Presentation Nausea, emesis, intermittent colic, bloating, constipation Obstipation if completely obstructed, loss of flatulence Exam: classically with \"tinkling\" bowel sounds, tympanic abdomen, distended abdomen Evaluation CBC, BMP, lipase, hepatic function panel, lactate (sensitive, not specific for ischemia) Start with KUB to rule out perforation but typically will require CT (x-ray only ~80% sensitive) CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is optimal study if adequate renal function No oral contrast (American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria) as it will not aid diagnosis and can lead to aspiration; IV helps evaluate ischemia Key word: transition point Non-specific signs of bowel inflammation: bowel wall thickening, submucosal edema Management Consult EGS: if any concern for SBO, evaluate need for urgent surgery Surgical indications \u2192 complete obstruction, CT with ischemia, perforation Gastric decompression: place NGT (prevent aspiration) NPO until obstruction relieved and NGT removed Fluids: two large bore IVs (nursing communication); LR bolus + maintenance while NPO If no resolution of partial obstruction at 48 hours: Fluoroscopy Upper GI small bowel ft (follow through) In comments, write \"Gastrografin contrast\" (water-soluble contrast) which osmotically reduces bowel wall edema and aids peristalsis If gastrografin reaches the colon within 24 hours, it predicts clinical resolution of SBO without surgery Note this can also be therapeutic for pSBO and get bowels moving Nausea & Vomiting Author: Taylor Riggs Etiology: VOMMIIT mnemonic V estibular: Labyrinthitis, vestibular neuritis, Meniere's disease, cerebellar stroke O bstruction: adhesions, hernia, volvulus, constipation, gastric outlet obstruction M otility: gastroparesis, GERD, autonomic dysfunction M edications: antibiotics, SSRI, opioids, cannabinoid hyperemesis I nfection: gastroenteritis, hepatitis, pyelonephritis, cholecystitis I nflammation: PUD, pancreatitis T oxins: uremia, ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, chemotherapy Evaluation All patients: CBC (leukocytosis, Hgb), BMP (AG, Ca, lytes, AKI), LFTs, lipase, lactate, UA If risk factors: consider TSH, AM cortisol, troponin, \u03b2 hCG, UDS EKG to eval for ischemia and baseline QTc Imaging If concern for obstruction (abd distention, decreased BMs) \u2192 KUB, consider CT A/P If concern for biliary pathology (RUQ pain, abnl LFTs) \u2192 RUQ U/S If vestibular/concern for CNS pathology \u2192 CTH vs MRI brain Management: Address underlying cause and stop medications as appropriate Many antiemetics prolong QTc, however in patients without underlying cardiac conduction abnormality, electrolyte abnormality, or organ failure the risk of QTc prolongation leading to significant arrhythmia is low. Obtain screening EKG in patients with underlying heart disease, electrolyte abnormalities, organ failure or on other QTc prolonging meds (antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics, antibiotics) 4-8 mg of IV Zofran is estimated to prolong QTc by ~6ms Try to pick a medication that will address the underlying etiology of nausea If patient does not respond to a medication in a certain class, try a medication from a different class (see below) Anti-Emetics Med (by class) Typical Dose Side Effects Prolongs QT?

thus, surgical resection of bowel is needed to relieve obstruction and rule out cancer Fistula: most commonly involves the bladder, vagina, small bowel, or uterus. Rarely heal spontaneously, therefore will require surgical correction. Bleeding: most common cause of overt lower GI bleeding in adults, typically resolves spontaneously. If persistent, endoscopic intervention to locate and stop the bleeding; if hemodynamically unstable, angiography is the next step to locate and/or control the bleed.

Avoid Megace (NNH = 23 for death) Liberalize dietary restrictions Nutritional Supplementation Address what matters most (long, short term goals) See Palliative Care section for resources on code status, goals of care discussions Medication Management Polypharmacy is defined as the regular use of five or more medications. It increases the risk of adverse drug effects, drug-drug interactions, or prescribing cascades whereby additional drugs are prescribed to treat other drugs' adverse events. Therefore, it is important to evaluate for polypharmacy by performing a medication reconciliation on admission, during transitions of care, and every clinic visit to determine if deprescribing is necessary. Pharmacologic considerations for older adults Pharmacokinetic (PK): Decreased hepatic and renal clearance. Reduction in first pass metabolism. Drug distribution changes due to decreased TBW and lean body mass resulting in relative increase in fat. Pharmacodynamic (PD): Exaggerated responses to pharmacologic therapy (therapeutic and adverse effects). Mantra for prescribing = \"start low and go slow\" Be aware of Prescribing Cascades: NSAIDs can lead to gastritis, which can lead to prescription of PPI, which can lead to B12 deficiency and prescription of vitamins Amlodipine can cause lower extremity edema leading to a diuretic prescription that can then lead to urinary incontinence and prescription of oxybutynin Common PIMs (Potentially Inappropriate Meds) See Beer's Criteria\u00ae (QR code in physical handbook for full consideration) Anticholinergics (e.g. antispasmodics, muscle relaxants, TCAs, antihistamines): confusion, dry mouth, constipation.

Potential for pulmonary toxicity, hepatotoxicity, and peripheral neuropathy Tips for med adherence: Assess current system for medication management Determine if medication timing is optimal for individual patient (e.g. diuretic dosing at night can increase nocturia but during day can risk incontinence/frequency) If organization is a barrier provide pillboxes or arrange blister packs for meds Recommended Tools: deprescribing.org (App available); medstopper.com Urinary Incontinence and Foleys Types of UI Mechanism Associated Symptoms Stress Incompetent urethral sphincter (e.g. post-prostatectomy, post childbirth) UI with physical exertion (cough, laughter, sneeze) Urge \u2191 bladder contraction from detrusor instability (e.g. infection, stone, T2DM, caffeine, meds, BPH) Frequency, nocturia, sudden urge Overflow \u2193 contractility/outlet obstruction (e.g. BPH, anticholinergic medications, T2DM, pelvic trauma, spinal cord disease, MS, polio) Hesitancy, weak stream, sense of incomplete emptying Functional Physical, emotional, or cognitive disability Depression, pain, evidence of physical, sensory, or cognitive impairment Evaluation: Perform a thorough Medication Reconciliation/History: Alcohol, \u03b1-Adrenergic agonists, \u03b1-Adrenergic blockers, ACE inhibitors, Anticholinergics, Antipsychotics, Calcium channel blockers, oral estrogen, GABAergic agents, NSAID's, narcotics Order Hemoglobin A1C, Electrolytes (particularly calcium), UA Rule out retention using PVR Pelvic exam to rule out prolapse Rectal exam to rule out fecal impaction Management: Skin care for urinary incontinence: Barrier creams: petroleum, zinc oxide Diapers only when up out of bed Chucks while in bed (do not hold moisture up close to the skin like diapers do) Offer toileting Q1-2hours Indications for a foley: Inability to void Need for accurate UOP monitoring when patient unable to comply Urinary Incontinence AND open sacral or perineal wound Perioperative Use Comfort care at end of life TOC/Disposition Urinary Incontinence and Foleys Background: Post-Acute Care Settings ALF: private pay, up to 2 ADL assist needs, 3 meals per day, medication administration may cost extra (typically lay person/med tech). No routine vitals, nursing assessments, labs, medical care on site Home health: Medicare beneficiaries qualify for skilled home health services (nursing, PT, speech/language therapy) if they are homebound, have a skilled need, and are certified by a clinician via face to face visit within 90 days before the start of care or 30 days after the start of care - Homebound: a person must rarely leave the home or require the assistance of another person, an assistive device, or special transportation to be able to leave the home. A homebound person may still leave the home for medical treatment or appointments, for religious services, or for brief, rare, nonmedical reasons.

Cancer screenings below are not recommended for older adults with at least moderate dementia or those near the end of life Older adults are generally open to conversations about stopping cancer screenings, especially when coming from a physician whom they trust. Work by Nancy L. Schoenborn recommends framing these conversations around age, health status, and helping people live longer but showed discussing life expectancy in this context can be controversial. Most compelling reason to stop screening: \"this test would not help you live longer\" instead of \"you may not live long enough to benefit from this test\" UCSF Time to Benefit Calculator can help determine which interventions could potentially benefit or harm your patient Resource: UCSF ePrognosis Score https://eprognosis.ucsf.edu/time_to_benefit.php Screening Cessation Guidance Mammogram (every 2 years)* Consider at age 75 Pap Smear* Stop at age 65 Colon Cancer (yearly for fecal occult blood test or every 10 years with colonoscopy)* Shared decision-making ages 76-85 Stop at age 86 Lung Cancer (annually in those at risk) Stop at age 75-80 *Not recommended for persons with < 10 years remaining life expectancy Other Screenings in Adults 65+ who are NOT at the end of life (AGS Guide) DEXA screening: at least once after age 65 in women or age 60 if high risk - Consider if not done previously and life expectancy 5 to < 10 years - TTB ~ 13 months so would consider in those with life expectancy > 2 years *(difference from AGS guide) - Not recommended for persons with moderate dementia Blood glucose: screen if patient likely to benefit; consider stopping at age 70 - Not recommended for persons with < 10 years remaining life expectancy or moderate dementia Cholesterol: Screen those with additional risk factors (smoking, DM, HTN, 10 year CVD event risk >10%) up to age 75 - Consider if life expectancy 5 to < 10 years - Not recommended for persons with moderate dementia Ultrasonography for AAA: once for men 65-75 who ever smoked, can consider in men who never smoked - Consider if life expectancy 5 to < 10 years - Not recommended for persons with moderate dementia HIV: consider for those at high risk Hepatitis B: consider for those at high risks Hepatitis C: once for those born 1945-1965 Home Safety Elder Abuse/Neglect/Exploitation Background: Affects up to 10% of community dwelling older adults and over 20% of older adults living in nursing homes Only 1 in 24 cases are reported Adult Protective Services (APS) investigates reports and will make appropriate referrals to resources within the community to help keep the individual in a safe environment.

NO platelet transfusions. ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion. Consult heme for management. Schistocytes on smear: Think TTP, HUS, or DIC when there are schistocytes on smear and thrombocytopenia For TTP: calculate PLASMIC score and consider ordering ADAMTS13 levels. Consult hematology about PLEX asap. Vascath is needed for PLEX. If DIC: consult hematology for management (supportive transfusions and may require heparin), identify underlying cause. Pancytopenia and Bicytopenia Author: Jamila Mammadova Background Pancytopenia is a decrease in all peripheral blood lineages (RBC, WBC, PLT). Many causes of pancytopenia can cause bicytopenia (decrease in any two cell lines), so the workup is similar Framework for differential Mechanism Causes Example (s) Bone marrow failure and suppression Infiltrative Malignancies (leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, metastatic solid tumors), amyloidosis, fibrosis (myelofibrosis) , hemochromatosis Bone marrow failure and suppression Myelodysplastic and hematologic syndromes Can be primary MDS or secondary (chemo, radiation), PNH Bone marrow failure and suppression Drug induced Antibiotics (chloramphenicol, linezolid, bactrim), antivirals (gancyclovir, zidovudine, ribavirin), immunosuppressants (AZA, MMF, MTX), antiepileptics (valproate, carbamazepine, phenytoin), antithyroid (PTU, methimazole), NSAIDs, chemotherapies Bone marrow failure and suppression Infection Sepsis, HIV, CMV, EBV, Parvovirus, HBV, HCV, TB, histo, tick-borne Bone marrow failure and suppression Toxicity Radiation, benzene exposure, arsenic (may be irreversible), EtOH Bone marrow failure and suppression Autoimmune SLE, RA/Felty syndrome, sarcoidosis, autoimmune subtype of aplastic anemia, Evan\u2019s syndrome Bone marrow failure and suppression Nutritional deficiency Vitamin B12, folate, copper (primary vs secondary to zinc toxicity), anorexia nervosa, malabsorptive diseases (i.e. Crohn\u2019s) Others Hemophagocytic syndromes Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) Others Consumption DIC (sepsis or acute PML) Others Splenomegaly Congestion (portal HTN), malignancies, EBV, autoimmune disorders Evaluation HPI: B-symptoms, fatigue, dyspnea, infections, bleeding/bruising, timing of symptoms Review medications (refer to the table above) PMHx: autoimmune disease (SLE, RA, scleroderma), radiation, gastric surgery, malabsorption (e.g. celiac, Crohn\u2019s), liver disease, malignancy, transplant , immunosuppression Social Hx: EtOH use, malnutrition, occupational exposures, travels, hiking, exposures to fungal infections, TB, leishmaniasis, or ticks Exam: look for lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, neuropathy, rashes, petechiae, mucosal bleed, stigmata of liver disease, cachexia, oral lesions CBC w/ diff, peripheral smear, IPF, reticulocyte count TMA/DIC labs: haptoglobin, LDH, LFTs, PT/PTT, fibrinogen, D-dimer, peripheral smear (for schistocytes), retics (will be high), renal function Infectious work-up (as clinically indicated): Viral serologies: HIV, HBV, HCV, EBV, CMV, parvovirus Sepsis: blood cultures, urine culture, sputum cultures Fungal work-up: 1,3-Beta-D-Glucan, aspergillus galactomannan, urine blasto Ag, urine and serum histo Ag, crypto Ag Tick-borne: RMSF, Ehrlichia, Anaplasma Leptospirosis TB and/or NTM: AFB, interferon-gamma release assay Autoimmune work-up (as clinically indicated): ESR, CRP, ANA w/ reflex, C3/C4, RF, APL antibodies Nutritional studies: B12, folate, copper, zinc, Fe Abdominal U/S to look for splenomegaly (or review recent imaging) HLH: ESR, CRP, ferritin, triglycerides, soluble IL-2R Consider flow cyt, bone marrow biopsy, cytogenetics, and FISH (c/s heme at this stage) Management Get type and screen and blood products transfusion consent if low counts or evidence of bleeding Hold DVT prophylaxis, avoid NSAIDs and ASA for platelet\\<50K Identifying the cause of pancytopenia is the biggest part of management (then find respective management tips in the handbook) Emergencies that may require urgent evaluation, management, or hospitalization - can\u2019t miss Neutropenia (ANC \\< 1000, or severe when ANC \\< 500) with fever or other evidence of infection Symptomatic anemia (cardiac symptoms like chest pain, SoB, HDUS, worsening CHF) Platelets \\< 10k or \\< 50k with bleeding Abnormal blood smear (schistocytes or blasts): suspect DIC, TMA HLH (unexplained fever, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, neurologic symptoms, very high ferritin, abnormal LFTs, coagulopathy) When pancytopenia is slow, progressive over time, or acute without any other precipitating factors and a specific etiology is in mind (e.g. leukemia or marrow infiltrating infection), consult hematology for consideration of bone marrow syndromes and/or bone marrow biopsy Note: Bone marrow biopsy for acquired pancytopenia in the hospital setting will often not yield results that will change clinical management (most likely will show an aplastic marrow) Supportive treatments to consider: Transfusions as indicated Consult heme for pharmacologic support options: G-CSF (Filgrastim) for neutropenia Erythropoietin stimulating agents for certain anemias TPO receptor agonists (Elthrombopag, Romiplostim) for certain thrombocytopenias Leukocytosis Author: Kenna Koehler Background Common progenitor cells (stem cells) are located in the bone marrow and give rise to erythrocytes, myeloblasts, megakaryoblasts Normal WBC can vary by age and pregnancy, for the purpose of this section will assume this is for an average, non-pregnant adult Chronic mild neutrophilic leukocytosis (10-20k) is common with tobacco use and obesity, both due to mechanisms related to chronic inflammation Reactive (typically 11k-30k): surgery, exercise, trauma, burns, emotional stress Leukemoid reaction (typically 50k-100k): severe infections (fulminant C difficile), organ rejection If greater than 100k, think leukemia or myeloproliferative disorder Evaluation Neutrophilia: neutrophil count >7k Bacterial infection, pregnancy, rheumatologic disease, steroids, beta agonists, lithium, colony-stimulating factors, splenectomy or functional asplenia, congenital (hereditary/chronic idiopathic neutrophilia), Down syndrome, leukocyte adhesion deficiency, malignancy, smoking, obesity Lymphocytosis: >40% of WBC count or >4,500k/mm3 Infections (pertussis, syphilis, CMV, EBV, hepatitis A/B/C, toxo), hypersensitivity reactions, thyrotoxicosis, Addison\u2019s disease, hematologic malignancies, \u201creactive\u201d Monocytosis: >8% of WBC count or >880/mm3 Infections (TB, fungal disease, protozoa, tick-borne), autoimmune disease, malignancy (CMML) Eosinophilia: >500/mm3 Hypersensitivity (asthma, urticaria, atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis), drug reactions, malignancies, connective tissue disease, idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome, infections (helminths, Scarlet fever, Hansen\u2019s disease), sarcoidosis, SLE Hypereosinophilia if AEC>1500, typically merits heme evaluation Hypereosinophilic syndrome: AEC>1500 and organ dysfunction from eosinophils Basophilia (>100/mm3) CML, thyroid disease, IBC, chronic dermatitis, infections (varicella) Venous Thromboembolism Author: Sarah Fittro Background Includes DVTs and PE. See \u201cPulmonary Embolism\u201d section in cardiology. Virchow\u2019s triad: stasis, vessel wall injury and hypercoagulability Risk factors for provoked DVT/PE Major risk factors: major surgery, trauma or fracture, active cancer (Pancreatic, brain, lung, ovarian, and metastatic cancers are highest risk), prior VTE, prolonged immobility such as hospitalization >3 days or SCI, inherited hypercoagulability, pregnancy and postpartum period (first 6 weeks) Minor Risk Factors: older age, obesity, hormone therapy, smoking, minor surgery Non-transient risk factors: malignancy (active), myeloproliferative disorders, IBD, liver disease, COPD, CHF, CKD, hereditary thrombophilia (factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene mutations most common), antiphospholipid syndrome, prior VTE. Evaluation Asymmetric calf swelling of >2cm sensitivity and specificity for DVT of 60-70% Classic triad of PE: SOB, pleuritic chest pain and coughing +/- hemoptysis Wells\u2019 Criteria for DVT can help guide diagnostic testing If a pt has a low pre-test probability, a negative D-dimer can rule out DVT In a high pre-test probability pt a negative D-dimer is less helpful Whole-leg ultrasounds with doppler is gold standard for DVT CT pulmonary angiography is gold standard for PE (lesser alternative V/Q scan) Management Prophylaxis: Padua score Score > 4 high risk, VTE risk \\~11% over 90 days without prophylaxis. Recommend pharmacologic prophylaxis (enoxaparin 40 mg SC daily or ppx dose heparin) Score \\<4 is low risk; recommend ambulation and SCDs Treatment (see anticoagulation section) Heparins: UFH or LMWH, e.g., enoxaparin starts immediately. DOACs: Rivaroxaban or apixaban can be first-line (no heparin bridge needed). Warfarin: Started with UFH/LMWH overlap (5+ days) until INR is 2-3, then heparin stops. Severe PE: Thrombolytics (e.g., alteplase) for massive PE with hemodynamic instability Embolectomy (surgical or catheter-based) if thrombolysis fails. Duration of treatment Provoked: 3-6 months or until provoking factor (trauma, surgery) is resolved Unprovoked (e.g., cancer, genetic defects): typically requires life-long anticoagulation along with assistance from hematology Complications * Post-Thrombotic Syndrome: Chronic leg pain, swelling, ulcers from vein damage (20-50% of DVT cases). Compression stockings reduce risk of this. Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH): Rare, from unresolved PE causing lung artery pressure buildup. Anticoagulation in malignancy - Treatment of established VTE (ASCO 2021): LMWH or DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban). Avoid DOACs in GI/GU cancers due to bleeding risk. - Primary Prophylaxis * Khorana Score: Predicts VTE risk in outpatients on chemo * Apixaban 2.5 mg BID, rivaroxaban 10 mg daily, or LMWH for high-risk outpatients (e.g., pancreatic cancer, Khorana \u22652). Additional Information Should we get a follow up ultrasound? When it\u2019s typically not needed: provoked DVT with clear resolution: If DVT was triggered by transient risk and symptoms resolve, follow-up imaging isn\u2019t routine. When it\u2019s recommended or considered: unprovoked DVT with no clear trigger suggests underlying risk (e.g., factor V Leiden, cancer). F/u ultrasound can: Assess residual clot to guide whether to extend AC Assess persistent residual vein occlusion which doubles recurrence risk. What about IVC filters? Select circumstances for these: In pts with acute DVT or PE and in whom anti-coagulation is absolutely contraindicated (thrombocytopenia, recent intra-cranial bleed, recent GI bleed) or recurrent PE despite adequate AC Placement of a retrievable IVC filter should be discussed with Hematology and IR Complications of IVC filters include filter thrombosis, migration/fracture, perforation and retrieval issues (PREPIC trials (1998, 2005) showed filters reduce PE risk short-term but increase DVT recurrence long-term, with no mortality benefit) Anticoagulation Author: Sarah Fittro Vitamin K Antagonist Warfarin (Coumadin) - Tx Dose: Highly individualized; typically started at 2\u20135 mg orally once daily, then adjusted based on INR (International Normalized Ratio). - Target INR: * 2.0\u20133.0: For most indications (e.g., AF, DVT, PE). * 2.5\u20133.5: For mechanical heart valves or certain other conditions.

Avoid if CrCl \\<15 mL/min. - Hold prior to procedure: At least 48 hours Additional Information - VA is starting to move towards rivaroxaban and apixaban for extended secondary thromboprophylaxis * Write in your PADR for apixaban citing \u201cpt uses a pillbox and cannot use dabigatran\u201d - Hx of GI bleed: Apixiban (Eliquis) has the best GI safety profile among DOACs. Avoid dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban (may have higher risk of GI bleed). Warfarin has higher risk of GI bleed than apixaban but lower than dabigatran or rivaroxaban in some analyses (e.g., GI bleeding rate \\~1\u20133% per year, depending on INR control). - Pregnancy: UFH/LMWH (other agents may cross the placenta). Warfarin is a known teratogen in 1st trimester and has fetal bleeding risk in 2nd/3rd trimester. DOACs cross placenta and there is limited human data, animal studies suggest fetal harm. - BMI >40: Consider LMWH (dose is weight based) or warfarin (able to target INR). Fixed-dose regimens (e.g., DOACs) may underperform in extreme obesity. Apixaban or rivaroxaban can be used per ISTH guidelines (but avoid dabigatran and edoxaban) - GI malabsorption (e.g. Crohn's): Caution with DOACs, consider LMWH or warfarin. - Duration: Varies by condition (e.g., 3\u20136 months for provoked DVT, lifelong for AF or recurrent events). Transitioning between Anticoagulants with DOACs From To Timing DOAC Warfarin Low-moderate risk DVT/PE: start warfarin while pt is on DOAC, stop DOAC on day 3 of warfarin therapy, and check INR on day 4 High risk DVT/PE: start LMWH or UFH, then start warfarin DOAC LMWH Stop DOAC and start LMWH when due for next DOAC dose DOAC UFH Start IV heparin with bolus when next DOAC dose is due LMWH Warfarin LMWH and warfarin given simultaneously until INR is therapeutic for 24h LMWH DOAC Stop LMWH and start DOAC when due for next dose of LMWH (within 2h) UFH DOAC Start DOAC when IV stopped (30min prior to cessation if high risk for thrombosis) Warfarin DOAC Start DOAC when INR \\< 2.0 Peri-procedural Management of Anticoagulation Temporary IVC filter indicated in pts with very recent acute VTE (within 3-4 weeks) if the procedure requires AC delay >12 hours For those at high risk of thromboembolism Consider continuing AC for low-bleeding-risk procedures like dental procedures, cutaneous biopsy/excision, ICD placement, and endovascular procedures. Can bridge with LMWH or heparin drip Stop before procedure Restart after procedure Warfarin 5 days prior, check INR day of 12 to 24 hours after Dabigatran Rivaroxaban Apixaban Edoxaban 48 hours prior (longer if CrCl 30-50 or procedure is high bleeding risk) 1 day after (2 days if high bleeding risk) Heparin Stop infusion 4-5 hours prior 24 hours after Enoxaparin 12 - 24 hours prior 24 hours after, (48-72 hours if high bleeding risk) Hypercoagulable States Author: Sarah Fittro Background Virchow\u2019s triad: 1. Hypercoagulability 2. Stasis 3. Endothelial injury Diagnostic thrombophilia testing indications Recurrent unprovoked VTE Severe first VTE (e.g., massive PE, no cause) First VTE at \\<50 years old (e.g., 32-year-old with spontaneous DVT) VTE in the setting of strong family history VTE in unusual vascular site (cerebral, renal, mesenteric) Recurrent pregnancy loss Arterial thrombosis at a young age Strong family history Must consider if thrombophilia testing will change clinical management If the unprovoked VTE warrants indefinite anticoagulation then testing may not be helpful However, if VTE provoked by minor risk factor (OCPs) with an underlying thrombophilia might change the decision, then testing may be informative Separated into hereditary and acquired conditions Hereditary: Factor V Leiden mutation Prothrombin mutation Protein C or S deficiency Antithrombin deficiency Dysfibrinogenemia (rare) Elevated factor VIII (possible genetic component) Hyperhomocysteinemia (inherited component due to mutations (e.g., MTHFR)) Acquired Antiphospholipid syndrome Active cancer or occult malignancy Immobilization (bedridden, hip/knee replacement) Major surgery/trauma Smoking Obesity (BMI \u226530 kg/m\u00b2, especially visceral fat) Pregnancy and postpartum period (first 6 weeks) Hormonal therapy (OCPs (especially estrogen-containing), hormone replacement therapy, or selective estrogen receptor modulators (e.g., tamoxifen). Myeloproliferative neoplasms (e.g., polycythemia vera or essential thrombocytopenia) Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria Heparin induced thrombocytopenia Nephrotic syndrome (risk correlates with albumin \\<2.0 g/dL) Inflammatory states like inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or acute infections (e.g., sepsis). Acquired hyperhomocysteinemia (elevated homocysteine from B12/folate deficiency, renal failure, or smoking) Note: Travel (plane, train, automobile) is NOT on this list and this is NOT considered a provoking risk factor Testing: All specific testing for hereditary disorders and APS should be performed at least 4-6 weeks after an acute thrombotic event or discontinuation of anticoagulant/thrombolytic therapies to avoid interference. Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome (APLS) Background Most common acquired disorder (anti-phospholipid antibodies present in 3-5% population) Thrombotic Risk: Venous (DVT, PE), arterial (stroke, MI), or microvascular thrombosis; recurrent pregnancy loss. Evaluation This is a clinicopathologic diagnosis (need both clinical and laboratory criteria) Triggers: Often associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or standalone (\u201cprimary APS\u201d). Diagnosis requires clinical event (thrombosis or pregnancy morbidity) + positive antibody test on two occasions, 12 weeks apart: Lupus anticoagulant: can occur in relation to drugs or infection Anticardiolipin antibodies \u03b2 2GP1 (anti- \u03b22-glycoprotein) antibodies Management Consider aspirin for primary prevention (persistent aPL without thrombosis/pregnancy loss) if high risk. VTE: indefinite warfarin (INR 2-3) Arterial thrombosis: warfarin +/- antiplatelet agent such as aspirin Do NOT use DOACs for triple positive APLS (see TRAPS trial: rivaroxaban inferior to warfarin) Hydroxychloroquine: reduces aPL levels and thrombosis risk in SLE-associated APS Statins: considered in arterial APS for endothelial protection Rituximab for recurrent thrombosis despite anticoagulation (controversial): call Hematology Catastrophic APS (CAPS) Presentation Rapid Onset: Thrombosis in \u22653 organs, systems, or tissues within a week. Common Sites: Kidneys (renal failure, hypertension). Lungs (acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS], pulmonary embolism). Brain (stroke, seizures, encephalopathy). Heart (myocardial infarction, valve thrombosis). Skin (livedo reticularis, purpura, necrosis). Adrenals (adrenal insufficiency). Systemic Inflammatory Response: Fever, elevated inflammatory markers (e.g., CRP, ESR), often mimicking sepsis. Triggers: Identified in \\~50% of cases\u2014e.g., infection (most common), surgery, trauma, pregnancy, or anticoagulation withdrawal. Criteria for definite CAPS Evidence of multi-organ involvement (3 or more) Clinical or imaging evidence of thrombosis or dysfunction (e.g., CT/MRI showing stroke, renal infarcts). Confirmation by histopathology of small vessel occlusion Laboratory confirmation of aPL antibodies (detected on 2 occasions 12 weeks apart) Absence of alternative diagnoses (Exclude mimics like TTP, HUS, DIC or HIT) Management IV heparin and high dose steroids For refractory cases: consider PLEX, IVIG, rituximab Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Type 1: Non-immune, benign thrombocytopenia due to direct heparin effects. Platelet drop within 1\u20134 days of heparin start. Mild decrease (e.g., 10\u201330% from baseline). No thrombosis or skin lesions. No intervention needed; continue heparin if clinically indicated. Platelet count normalizes with continued heparin therapy Type 2: Immune-mediated, prothrombotic condition requiring urgent intervention. Risk Factors: UFH > LMWH, surgical patients (especially orthopedic/cardiac), females, higher heparin doses. Platelet count drops \u226550% from baseline. Typical onset: 5\u201314 days after heparin exposure (first exposure). Rapid onset: Within 24 hours if prior heparin exposure within 30\u2013100 days (antibody persistence). Thrombosis: Venous (DVT, PE) > arterial (stroke, MI, limb ischemia). Unusual sites: adrenal vein (hemorrhage), skin necrosis at injection sites. Occurs in 30\u201350% of untreated cases; risk persists 4\u20136 weeks post-heparin cessation. Symptoms: Thrombosis-related (e.g., leg swelling, chest pain). Skin lesions (erythema, necrosis) in \\~10%. Bleeding rare unless severe thrombocytopenia Evaluation 4T score (0-8 points): Thrombocytopenia (0-2 pts): degree and nadir of platelet count drop Timing (0-2 pts): timing of fall after initial or recurrent heparin exposure Thrombosis (0-2 pts): thrombosis, skin necrosis, non-necrotizing lesions, acute systemic reaction to heparin Other causes of thrombocytopenia (0-2 pts): more points if no alternate cause Interpretation: Low (0\u20133), Intermediate (4\u20135), High (6\u20138) Screening: Anti-PF4/heparin ELISA (IgG-specific); optical density (OD) >0.4 suggests positivity (higher OD \\= higher risk). Confirmation: Functional assay (e.g., serotonin release assay [SRA], heparin-induced platelet activation [HIPA]); >20% serotonin release confirms HIT. The lab at VUMC will perform functional SRA reflexively for all values >0.2 Management 0-3 points: Low concern for HIT; can restart heparin 4-5 points: Intermediate probability (\\~10%); hold heparin, start non-heparin anticoagulant 6 points: High probability (\\~50%); hold heparin, start non-heparin anticoagulant Argatroban (direct thrombin inhibitor) for prophylaxis and treatment of thrombosis Avoid platelet transfusions as can increase thrombogenic effect Avoid warfarin until complete platelet recovery as may cause microthrombosis Hematology consult for all confirmed HIT Factor V Leiden Mutation Factor V Leiden (FVL) is the most common inherited thrombophilia, caused by a point mutation (G1691A) in the F5 gene, leading to resistance of activated Factor V to inactivation by activated protein C (APC). Evaluation Screen with activated protein C resistance assay in select cases (unprovoked VTE, family history). APC ratio in pt vs. normal Normal >2.0, heterozygotes 1.5-2.0, homozygotes \\<1.5 Factor V Leiden mutation can then be confirmed via PCR Screen with APC assay rather than PCR initially; cost effective Management VTE treatment same as general population VTE 3-8x risk in heterozygotes; 50-80x risk in homozygotes Avoid combined oral contraceptives/HRT; progestin-only options safer. Prothrombin Gene Mutation Evaluation: PCR of G20210A mutation (2-4% prevalence) Thrombotic Risk: Primarily affects venous system; minimal impact on arterial thrombosis (e.g., stroke, MI) unless combined with other risk factors. Management: Treat VTE as usual; extend anticoagulation for unprovoked/recurrent cases; prophylaxis in high-risk settings for carriers. Avoid OCPs Protein C and S Deficiency Background Pathophysiology: Impaired inactivation of Factors Va/VIIIa increases clotting. Both are autosomal dominant; first event occurs between 10-50 years of age Synthesized in liver and Vit K dependent; therefore, low levels in hepatic dysfunction and warfarin use/vitamin K deficiency Protein C: low in settings of thrombosis, DIC, nephrotic syndrome, intra/post-op Protein S: low in infectious (HIV) and autoimmune processes (IBD) Protein S decreases during pregnancy (decreased free protein S, normal total protein S) Do not misdiagnose a pregnant pt with PS deficiency Evaluation Functional Protein C and S assays Management VTE treatment same as general population Avoid OCPs/HRT High risk pts may require protein C concentrate prior to surgery Increased risk of warfarin-induced skin necrosis Antithrombin Deficiency Background Autosomal dominant with variable penetrance. Unprovoked VTE (DVT, PE) often \\<40\u201350 years; 50\u201370% lifetime risk by age 60. Unusual sites: Cerebral, mesenteric, portal vein thrombosis. Acquired deficiency can be caused by liver disease (decreased synthesis), nephrotic syndrome (urinary loss), DIC, or heparin therapy (consumption). Transient, not genetic; managed by treating underlying condition. Evaluation Functional antithrombin activity (AT-heparin cofactor assay) Then perform antigen quantity testing Management Treat VTE as usual; indefinite anticoagulation for unprovoked cases; prophylaxis in triggers; antithrombin concentrate for severe/homozygous cases. Bleeding Coagulopathies \u2013 Sarah Fittro Bleeding tendency or dysfunction in clot formation can occur from either a quantitative or qualitative platelet defect, deficiency or inhibitor of coagulation factors, or compromise of vascular integrity Platelet disorders will present with mucocutaneous bleeding, petechiae, mild bleeding immediately following surgery, impaired wound healing Coagulation defects will present with deep tissue bleeding in joints/muscles resulting in hemarthroses, hematomas, sometimes delayed but severe bleeding after surgery, and intracranial hemorrhage Quantitative or Qualitative Platelet Defect Thrombocytopenia: see \u201cThrombocytopenia\u201d section von Willebrand Disease (vWD): Most common inherited bleeding disorder, affecting about 1% of the population (though many cases are mild and undiagnosed) but can also be acquired or secondary to other disease states. vWF has two big jobs: - Helps platelets stick: When a blood vessel is injured, vWF binds platelets to the damaged site to form a temporary plug. - Carries factor VIII: vWF protects factor VIII from breaking down and delivers it to where it\u2019s needed in the coagulation cascade. Types of vWD - Type 1 (60-80% of cases): Partial deficiency of vWF. Levels are low, but protein works. - Type 2 (15-30% of cases): vWF is present but defective. There are subtypes: * 2A: vWF can\u2019t form large, effective multimers (chains) needed for platelet binding. * 2B: vWF binds too aggressively to platelets, causing them to clump and get cleared from circulation, reducing both vWF and platelets. * 2M: vWF has trouble binding to platelets due to a structural flaw. * 2N: vWF can\u2019t properly carry factor VIII, mimicking mild hemophilia A. - Type 3 (1-5% of cases): Severe. Almost no vWF is produced, and factor VIII levels drop. - Acquired vWD: Rare, caused by drugs or diseases that destroy or block vWF such as: * Lymphoproliferative disorders: CLL, NHL, plasma cell dyscrasias * Myeloproliferative disorders: PV, ET, or myelofibrosis * Autoimmune diseases: SLE * Hypothyroidism * Sheer stress: aortic stenosis \u2013 Heyde syndrome, LVAD, ECMO * Heyde syndrome is a multisystem disorder characterized by a triad of aortic stenosis (causes high shear stress in blood flow), GI bleeding (from angiodysplasia in the gut) and acquired von Willebrand disease (type 2A) Clinical presentation: - Mild (Type 1): Easy bruising, frequent nosebleeds, menorrhagia, prolonged bleeding - Moderate (Type 2): Similar to Type 1 but more pronounced +/- petechiae - Severe (Type 3): Spontaneous hemarthrosis, symptoms resembling hemophilia. Diagnosis: \u201cvW Profile\u201d \\= vWF Ag, Factor VIII Activity, Ristocetin Cofactor Activity Management: - Desmopressin (DDAVP): Works for most Type 1 and some Type 2 cases. - vWF/Factor VIII Concentrates: For Type 3, severe Type 2, or when DDAVP fails. - Antifibrinolytics (e.g., Tranexamic Acid)**: - Platelet transfusions: Rarely, for Type 2B with severe thrombocytopenia. - Avoid NSAIDs Other causes of qualitative platelet defects - Uremic platelet dysfunction - Medications: NSAIDs, anti-platelets (ASA, Plavix), SSRIs (serotonin required for platelet activation), and melatonin (suggested by pre-clinical studies) Deficiency of Coagulation Factors Inherited Causes Hemophilia A is a deficiency of factor VIII and Hemophilia B is a deficiency of factor IX. Both are X-linked recessive and most commonly affect males. Frequently presents with hemarthroses and hematomas Diagnosis: isolated prolonged PTT with normalization upon mixing study Management: purified/recombinant Factor VIII or IX, mild disease can be managed with desmopressin, consult Benign Hematology on admission Factor XI Deficiency (Hemophilia C): Rare, autosomal recessive, caused by F11 gene mutations. Common in some populations (e.g., Ashkenazi Jews). Fibrinogen Disorders: Mutations in FGA, FGB, or FGG genes can lead to afibrinogenemia (no fibrinogen) or hypofibrinogenemia (low fibrinogen). Acquired Causes Liver Disease: The liver makes most clotting factors (II, V, VII, IX, X, plus fibrinogen). Vitamin K deficiency Dilutional coagulopathy: Massive blood or fluid resuscitation can dilute clotting factors DIC Leukemia, aplastic anemia, or chemotherapy can impair factor production by affecting megakaryocytes or plasma cells. Amyloidosis: can cause factor X deficiency Inhibitors of Coagulation Factors Acquired Inhibitors Acquired Hemophilia A: Antibodies against factor VIII. Rare. Onset in older age (60s) Frequently presents with significant intramuscular hematomas Disease associations in 50% of cases (other 50% idiopathic): autoimmune (e.g. SLE), malignancy (paraneoplastic), Pemphigus, drug-induced (e.g. interferon, penicillins), or chronic GvHD Diagnosis: Elevated PTT that does not normalize with mixing study Always consult hematology (rare disorder with major bleeding complications) Bleeding management: Typically need a factor VIII bypassing agent (FEIBA) Immunosuppression: prednisone 1mg/kg, rituximab often also used front line Factor V Inhibitors: Even rarer, linked to surgery, antibiotics, or autoimmune triggers. Alloantibodies in hemophilia: patients with congenital hemophilia A or B receiving factor VIII or IX infusions can develop antibodies. Other Inhibitory Mechanisms Liver disease: Beyond reducing factor production, cirrhosis can produce abnormal proteins (e.g., dysfibrinogenemia) that interfere with clotting. A FVIII level can help distinguish between liver dysfunction and DIC (elevated or normal in liver dysfunction and decreased in DIC since it is not hepatically derived) Drugs: Warfarin and DOACs intentionally reduce activity of vitamin K-dependent factors (II, VII, IX, X) as therapy Compromise of Vascular Integrity Background: Compromise of vascular integrity can contribute to a coagulopathy by disrupting the first step of hemostasis. Amyloidosis: Deposits infiltrate capillaries/arterioles and impair vasoconstriction and platelet adhesion. Can present as GI bleeding, purpura or ecchymoses (Raccoon eyes) Vasculitis: purpura, alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), intracranial hemorrhage, GI bleeding Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy): can present with bleeding gums, GI bleeding, ecchymoses, hematomas, anemia Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome: Defective collagen \\= vessels tear easily, resulting in bruising or even arterial rupture. Marfan Syndrome: Abnormal fibrillin in vessel walls alters subendothelial structure, potentially affecting platelet binding. Hereditary hemorrhagic Telangiectasia: 2nd most common inherited bleeding disorder. Often presents with epistaxis, GI bleeding DIC or thrombotic microangiopathies (e.g., HUS, TTP) can lead to endothelial injury and microclots, consuming platelets and factors, resulting in secondary bleeding. Allergic reactions: Histamine increases permeability \\= petechiae or ecchymosis. Cushing\u2019s Syndrome: Excess cortisol thins vessel walls \\= easy bruising. Infections (e.g., Ebola, Dengue): Viral damage to endothelium \\= hemorrhagic fever. Management - Labs: Normal PT, aPTT, and platelet counts rule out factor or platelet issues. - Clinical Signs: Petechiae, purpura, or mucosal bleeding without deep hematomas suggest vascular fragility over hemophilia-like factor defects. - Tests: Bleeding time (less used now) or skin biopsy (e.g., for collagen defects) can point to vessel problems. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) Author: Eric Singhi Background Concurrent activation of the coagulation pathway and fibrinolytic pathway Consumption of platelets, fibrin, and coagulation factors \ud83e\udc6a fibrinolysis \ud83e\udc6a end organ damage and hemolysis Etiologies: Infection/sepsis, liver disease, pancreatitis, trauma Malignancies: mucin-secreting pancreatic/gastric adenocarcinoma, brain tumors, prostate cancer, all acute leukemias, acute promyelocytic leukemia Obstetric complications: preeclampsia/eclampsia, placental abruption Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (e.g. ABO incompatible transfusion) Evaluation Exam: petechiae, bleeding (mucosal, IV site, surgical wound site, hematuria), ecchymoses, thrombosis (i.e. cold, pulseless extremities) Laboratory evaluation CBC, PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen, d-dimer, peripheral blood smear \u201cDIC labs\u201d: q6h fibrinogen, PT/INR, aPTT (space out when lower risk) Findings suggestive of DIC: thrombocytopenia, prolonged aPTT and PT/INR, hypofibrinogenemia, elevated D-dimer, fibrin degradation products, schistocytes A FVIII level can help distinguish between the DIC and liver dysfunction: elevated or normal in liver dysfunction and decreased in DIC since it is not hepatically derived Management Treat the underlying cause Vitamin K for INR > 1.7 or bleeding Hypofibrinogenemia treatment: Cryoprecipitate 5-10 units if fibrinogen \\< 100 Thrombocytopenia treatment: platelet transfusion as normally indicated DVT ppx if not bleeding and platelet > 50 VTE: anticoagulation if platelet > 50 and no massive bleeding Transfusion Medicine Authors: R. Dixon Dorand, Zoe Finer For emergent transfusions, call the blood bank (615-322-2233) - RNs on 10T and 11N can follow transfusion protocols for pRBCs and plts \u2013 enter as a \u201cNursing Communication\u201d or as part of the Hematology/Oncology Admission Order set. - At VUMC, all blood products are leukoreduced to reduce the risk of febrile nonhemolytic reactions. Other special processing of blood products (such as irradiation) will be decided by blood bank based on special considerations listed in order set. Examples include: stem cell transplant, hematologic malignancy, or thalassemia - Pts with frequent transfusions (e.g. sickle cell hemoglobinopathy) should have an \u201cRBC Extended Phenotype\u201d ordered (once) for minor RBC antigens to avoid immunization and antibody development to these proteins - You may ask the VUMC hematology lab to email you pictures of the peripheral smear VA: Orders Tab \u2013 Blood Bank Orders \u2013 follow prompts to select appropriate product.

Transfusing large amounts of RBCs can dilute coagulation factors, which is the reason for the matched ratio. - At VUMC can order a \u201cfastpack\u201d which includes 2u prbc and 2u plasma - Complications to monitor for: * Hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, (blood products have citrate as a preservative which binds to ca and affects mag levels) \u2192 replete with Ca gluconate and Magnesium Sulfate * Hyperkalemia \u2013 due to the breakdown of RBC in transfusion process * Hypothermia * Coagulopathy \u2013 due to the dilution of clotting factors discussed above. Transfusion Premedication and Reactions If you are concerned about a serious transfusion reaction, pause the transfusion and contact the blood bank ASAP Order the transfusion reaction blood testing in Epic. You will send a CBC, the bag of blood products, and the completed form to the blood bank for analysis Premedication: - Only if history of severe reaction * Diphenhydramine 25-50mg IV * Acetaminophen 650 mg PO * Meperidine 25-50 mg IV (optional for chills) * Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV (optional, for severe reactions or reactions despite acetaminophen and diphenhydramine) Reaction Signs & Symptoms Etiology Clinical Action Allergic (mild) Pruritus, hives limited to small area Antibodies to transfused plasma proteins Pause transfusion.

however, there are no current guidelines for the frequency of evaluation - Those with CCUS require closer surveillance due to a higher risk of progression to hematologic malignancy - Lifestyle modifications and management of cardiovascular risk factors are crucial - Currently, there are no FDA-approved therapies for CH-related disorders Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Author: Peter Hanna Background - MDS is a malignant clonal myeloid disorder resulting in ineffective (dysplastic) hematopoiesis leading to peripheral cytopenias and a risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) - Usually idiopathic, a disease of the elderly (median onset at age 70) - The WHO has several classification schemes for MDS * Most important for classification is the percent of blasts in the bone marrow * Note >20% blasts in marrow \\= AML. Thus MDS and AML are on a continuum Presentation - 50% asymptomatic; symptoms can include nonspecific but gradual fatigue, weakness - Dysplastic cells do not work properly \ud83e\udc6a infections and bleeding are more likely - Macrocytic anemia is most common finding; followed by bicytopenia or pancytopenia - Isolated neutropenia or thrombocytopenia are unusual but possible - Ask about secondary causes * Exposure to chemicals (benzene, crude oil/gasoline industry, cigarette smoke), chemotherapy, radiation * Medications, alcohol use, chronic infections (HIV) Evaluation - Goal is to rule out reversible causes of dysplasia and cytopenias - CBC w/differential, peripheral smear, B12, folate, HIV * Consider copper and zinc - Dysplastic changes on peripheral smear: hypogranulated/hyposegmented neutrophils, hypogranulated platelets and macrocytosis of RBCs * Circulating myeloblasts can be seen - Final diagnosis requires bone marrow biopsy Management - Molecular characteristics define the \u201crisk\u201d of the disease and dictates treatments - Prognostic scoring tools: revised international prognostic staging system (R-IPSS) - Management general paradigm * Asymptomatic: with low-risk disease: monitoring * Low-risk disease + symptoms due to anemia only: transfusions, erythrocyte stimulating agents, and treatment with Luspatercept * MDS with isolated del(5q): treated with lenalidomide * High-risk pts: treated with hypomethylating agents * Only curative intervention: hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) Acute Leukemia Author: AJ Winer Background Definition of Acute Leukemia: hematological malignancy caused by clonal proliferation of blasts (WBC precursors) in the bone marrow Types : Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) : neoplastic accumulation of immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow AML includes subtype Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia, defined by the translocation (15;17) PML-RARA Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) : neoplastic accumulation of immature lymphoblasts in the bone marrow Includes subtypes B-ALL and T-ALL Exposure: radiation, chemo (alkylating agents), smoking, benzene Secondary to acquired condition: MDS, MPN, HIV, aplastic anemia, Down Syndrome Presentation: - Symptoms - related to cytopenias: * Anemia: fatigue, pallor, dyspnea * Functional leukopenia/neutropenia: recurrent infection * Thrombocytopenia: gingival bleeding, epistaxis, petechiae, ecchymoses, menorrhagia * Leukocytosis: leukemia cutis, gingival hypertrophy, leukostasis * Extramedullary hematopoiesis: splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy Oncologic Emergencies related to leukemia: See oncologic emergencies for more in depth discussion, but can present with leukostasis (blast >50k, low SaO2, HA, blurry vision, neurologic sx), TLS (from rapid cell turnover), DIC (esp APL), differentiation syndrome (see section below) Evaluation: Initial studies (peripheral blood) peripheral smear, search for Auer rods and schistocytes Fibrinogen, PT/PTT, haptoglobin to survey for DIC If high concern for AML, can send a peripheral blood FISH for 15:17 translocation (PML-RARa), cinch APL diagnosis quickly immunophenotyping by flow cytometry (assess cell-surface and cytoplasmic markers: CDxx), Definitive studies (done on bone marrow biopsy): immunophenotyping by flow cytometry (assess cell-surface and cytoplasmic markers: CDxx), genetic and mutational analysis (assess for therapeutic targets - FLT3, IDH1, etc) Cytogenetic analysis (screening for gene rearrangements - PML::RARA, BCR::ABL1, etc) Diagnosis of acute leukemia requires one of the following: Traditionally, required 20% blasts in peripheral blood, 20% blasts in bone marrow, any pathognomonic cytogenetic abnormality of t(8;21), inv(16), t(15;17) Now, for certain recurrent genetic lesions, \u226510% blasts in bone marrow or blood now indicate AML (ie AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities, AML with mutated TP53, AML with myelodysplasia-related gene mutations, etc - see ELN guidelines) Exclusions to above include AML with BCR::ABL1 which requires >/=20% blasts to avoid overlap with CML in accelerated phase, among others Management: Once diagnosis is established and patient admitted to Brittingham, they will need the following: Hematology admission order set TLS labs q8 Blood product consent on admission, set RBC and Plt transfusion thresholds Infectious workup if neutropenic and febrile Nurse-driven electrolyte repletion ECG and TTE to establish pre-chemotherapy cardiac function Double lumen PICC line for chemotherapy induction if indicated Daily labs: CBC, TLS, DIC Bone marrow cytogenetics and flow cytometry for immunophenotype LP if clinical sx suspicious of CNS involvement or if c/f ALL Emergent complications of leukemia and their labs to consider: DIC \u2013 check fibrinogen, PT, PTT, platelets TLS \u2013 check uric acid, phosphate, K+ Neutropenic fever \u2013 check temp, neutrophil count, BCx Leukostasis (see below) Induction Therapy General strategy: \u201cinduction\u201d chemo to try to induce clinicopathologic (as opposed to molecular) \u201cremission\u201d \\= complete remission (CR). CR is absence of symptoms, normal CBC (ANC >10k, Plt >100), and \\<5% blasts in bone marrow (on day 28) The choice of therapy is often affected by patient fitness, which is affected by age, presence of serious comorbidity, and functional status as measured by the ECOG scale. For instance, while a \u201cfit\u201d patient with AML might receive 7+3 induction therapy, patients who are older than 75, have an ECOG 4>, or patients with cardiopulmonary disease would more likely receive a regimen like azacytidine/venetoclax. response is assessed with bone marrow biopsy, usually on Day 14 Patients stay in the hospital after induction, until their cytopenias recover (generally until neutrophil count >500) From there, bone marrow transplant (for high-risk disease) or \u201cconsolidation\u201d chemo for normal-risk or low-risk disease Acute Myelogenous Leukemia Background - Definition: abnormal proliferation of myeloblasts in BM or peripheral smear - 80% of acute leukemias in adults are AML - Classification: * Features used to confirm myeloid lineage and subclassify AML to guide treatment: morphology: blasts, granules, auer rods * Immunophenotype: * precursor: CD34, CD45, HLA-DR * Myeloid: CD13, CD33, CD117 * Monocyte: CD11b, CD64, CD14, CD15 * Prognosis: age, prior antecedent MPN/MDS, and genetics (cytogenetics + molecular mutation status) are independent risk factors of poor prognosis European Leukemia Net (ELN) Genetic Risk classification: Risk category Genetic Abnormality Favorable APL: t(15;17); PML-RARa; t(8;21): RUNX1-RUNX1T1; inv(16): CBFB-MYH1; mutated NPM1 w/o FLT3-ITD or w/ FLT3-ITDlow*; biallelic mutation in CEBPA Intermediate FLT3-ITDlow*; mutated NPM1 & FLT3-ITDhigh*; t(9;11): MLL- MLLT3; cytogenetic abnl not classified as favorable or adverse, including normal karyotype w/o mutations in FLT3-ITD & NPM1 Adverse -5 or del(5q); -7; -17/abn(17p); complex or monosomal karyotype; t(6;9): DEK-NUP214; t(9;22) BCR-ABL1; inv(3): GATA2- MECOM; wildtype NPM1 & FLT-ITD high*; mutated TP53, RUNX1, ASXL Treatment: Induction chemotherapy: Based on patient fitness: Typical is \u201c7+3\u201d: idarubicin on days 1-3 + cytarabine on days 1-7 Patients with poor fitness often receive hypomethylating agent (HMA) therapy with azacytidine or decitabine with Venetoclax. If therapy-related AML, MDS-related AML, or AML with cytogenetics similar to MDS, use \u201cVyxeos\u201d which is liposomal daunorubicin and cytarabine on days 1, 3, and 5 If favorable-risk dz (t(8;21) or inv(16)), use cytarabine on days 1-7, and 3 days of low-dose daunorubicin + gemtuzumab-ozogamicin Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) Definition: translocation of retinoic acid receptor: t(15;17) PML-RARA Specific findings: promyelocytes on differential or Auer rods on smear Treatment: depends on whether pt is high risk or non-high-risk, but for both, give ATRA + Arsenic Trioxide (ATO) to induce differentiation of blasts Non-high-risk APL: ATRA + ATO (Induction + 4c consolidation) High-risk APL: WBC >10k. Often chemo along with ATRA + ATO Complications that can arise: DIC and differentiation syndrome Differentiation syndrome: Mechanism: promyelocytes will differentiate from ATRA resulting in a constellation of life-threatening complications Complications include Pulmonary edema, subarachnoid hemorrhage, hypotension Risk is higher with higher WBC counts before ATRA (above 20,000 especially) Management: dexamethasone 10mg BID, supportive care. If critically ill, hold ATRA and ATO and consider hydroxyurea Acute lymphogenous Leukemia Classification: Lymphoblastic neoplasms may present as: ALL with >20% BM blasts Lymphoblastic lymphoma with mass lesion and \\<20% BM blast No granules seen +TdT seen in 95% of ALL Lumbar puncture is performed, with co-administration of intrathecal chemo Treatment: -

Leukostasis is hyperleukocytosis + clinical symptoms of decreased tissue perfusion in end organs (CNS, lungs, heart, kidneys, etc). Typically manifests in leukemias (i.e. AML; Less common in CML/CLL unless there is a significant increase in peripheral blasts). Pathophysiology: Leukostasis is thought to be due to increased blood viscosity caused by a large population of leukemic blasts that are less deformable than mature leukocytes. As blasts increase in the blood, plugs of these more rigid cells form in the microcirculation and impede flow. The blast-endothelial cell interactions lead to endothelial cell damage, cytokine release, and subsequent hemorrhage and local hypoxemia within tissues, most notably the CNS and lungs. Presentation: - Common symptoms include: visual changes, headaches, dizziness, dyspnea, hypoxia, fever. Less common symptoms: abdominal pain, priapism, limb pain. Evaluation: - CBC w/ diff, peripheral blood smear, DIC and TLS labs - CT head to evaluate neuro deficit and to check for ICH - Chest X-Ray vs. CT chest to evaluate dyspnea and air space abnormalities - Note: PaO2 by ABG often falsely low from WBC consuming O2 in vitro. Trust SpO2. Management: - Call Hematology - Transfer/admit to ICU - Emergent cytoreduction * Leukapheresis: page Nephrology and place dialysis catheter * Hydroxyurea and chemotherapy per hematology fellow * Don\u2019t transfuse PRBC before taking care of leukostasis as transfusion will increase viscosity Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) Definition: A phenomenon caused by tumor cell lysis that results in the release of electrolytes into the bloodstream. Pathophysiology: - Malignancies can be associated with high turnover rates or high sensitivity to treatment leading to quick tumor lysis. This causes release of large amounts of potassium, phosphate, and nucleic acids that can further contribute to metabolic derangements. Presentation: - Symptoms reflect the metabolic abnormalities seen with hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia. These symptoms can include: hypotension, AKI, arrythmias, nausea, diarrhea, seizures, lethargy, and even lead to death. Evaluation: - TLS labs (25% change from baseline in these values) * Uric acid \u2265 8, Ca2+ \u2264 7, K+ \u2265 6, or PO43- \u2265 4.5 - Risk Stratification: * Highest risk after starting chemotherapy, but can occur spontaneously * Highest risk if rapidly progressive, chemo-sensitive, myelo or lymphoproliferative disease; bulky disease, extensive organ/marrow infiltration - Tumor characteristics which confer a higher risk of developing TLS * High (>5% risk): ALL (WBC> 100K or LDH 2x ULN), AML (WBC> 100K), Burkitt\u2019s (III/IV or LDH\u22652xULN, DLBCL with bulky disease, intermediate risk + AKI/CKD * Intermediate: ALL (WBC\\<100K, LDH \\<2x ULN), AML (WBC 25-100K), Burkitt\u2019s LDH\\<2x ULN), DLBCL (non-bulky, LDH>ULN), CLL (if tx with fludarabine, rituximab, lenalidomide, or venetoclax +LN 5-10 cm or ALC\u226525K), plasma cell leukemia, rare chemo-sensitive solid tumors (small cell) * Low: all others Management: - Prevention: * High risk: q6-8h TLS labs, IVF (\u00b1loop diuretic if volume overload), allopurinol, \u00b1 rasburicase * Intermediate \u2013 q8h TLS labs, IVF, allopurinol * Low \u2013 daily TLS labs, IVF * IVF: goal to maintain UOP 80-100 mL/hr * Allopurinol: 300 mg PO BID for CrCl > 20 mL/min, UpToDate renal dosing if lower * Rasburicase ($$$): contraindicated in G6PD (send G6PD if not urgent and AA, Asian or Jewish descent) * Given if uric acid > 8 mg/dL.

Consider Nephrology consultation early if worsening Cr, refractory symptoms, or refractory electrolyte abnormalities. Superior Vena Cava (SVC) Syndrome Background - It occurs due to obstruction of blood flow in the SVC leading to upstream congestion in the upper extremities, head and neck. - Can be secondary to a mass in the mediastinum or thrombosis (e.g. foreign body, central venous catheter) - Commonly associated malignancies: lung cancer (NSCLC or SCLC), Non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin lymphoma, mediastinal germ cell tumors, thymic malignancies Presentation - Facial or neck swelling without generalized edema - Sense of head fullness, exacerbated by leaning forward or lying down - Pulmonary: dyspnea, stridor, hoarseness, cough (due to edema narrowing the nasal passages and larynx or mechanical airway obstruction) - Physical features include: facial/neck edema, distended neck and chest veins, upper extremity swelling, LN enlargement (supraclavicular, cervical, axillary), papilledema, and plethora. Evaluation - CXR: may show mass, perihilar or mediastinal disease, mediastinal widening, or pleural effusion - Contrasted CT scan \u00b1 CT Venography: phased to get a view of clot contribution to obstruction to guide decision regarding anticoagulation or stenting - MRI/MRV may provide additional information (often not possible due to pt too sick) - Non-malignant causes on the differential: post-radiation fibrosis, fibrosing mediastinitis (can be seen from prior infections such as histoplasma, TB, nocardiosis, aspergillus, blastomycosis), central AV fistula Management - Assess airway and prepare for intubation if needed - Keep head of bed elevated - Thrombosis: * Removal of lines/catheters associated with thrombus * Consideration of anticoagulation - Tumor compression: the type of tumor guides treatment (tissue biopsy is key) * Stat/urgent consultations to consider: * Interventional radiology: possible stenting/dilatation (Fastest modality, if available) * Radiation oncology: radiation therapy (Takes days to weeks to work) * Medical oncology: help with diagnosis and chemotherapy (Fast if highly chemo-responsive cancer * Interventional pulmonology: help with tissue dx Spinal Cord Compression Background - Malignancies where cord compression is most common: * Multiple myeloma, lymphoma (both Hodgkin and NHL); lung, breast, and prostate cancer - Tumor mass, compression, and often displaced bone occupies the epidural space and impinges on the thecal sac or nerve roots of the spinal cord or any spinal nerves including the cauda equina. This can lead to edema of the spinal cord white and gray matter, which eventually leads to infarction of the cord. This vasogenic edema is where glucocorticoids can play a role. Presentation - Back pain (most often initial symptom, typically worse at night), progressive motor, or sensory deficits (saddle anesthesia, numbness, paresthesias) - Cauda equina syndrome: bowel or bladder incontinence, ataxia Evaluation - Neurologic exam with sensation testing seeking level below an identified dermatome - Back pain that exacerbated by movement -> mechanically unstable spine until proven otherwise (requires surgical evaluation and potential stabilization) - Lab testing: If no known malignancy check CBC, CMP, SPEP, and (in males) PSA - Bladder U/S if suspicion or retention with or without overflow incontinence - If suspected, order whole spine MRI w and w/o contrast. If pt unable to have MRI, CT myelography may be considered. Management - Immediate high dose steroids: give dexamethasone to minimize mineralocorticoid effects. Most common dosing is 10mg IV x1 followed by 4mg PO or IV q6h - Consider stat/urgent consultation with: * Spine Team (Neurosurgery or Orthopedic surgery holds pager): consult early, ask for an operative plan from them ASAP. Affects other possible interventions. * Radiation oncology: one of the rare cases where overnight radiation would be considered. Requires that patient is able to lie flat for a CT simulation (rad onc orders this), and rad onc cannot proceed until Spine surgery makes a definitive call about whether or not to operate first * Medical oncology: help with diagnosis and chemotherapy - Ensure regular neuro-vascular checks and close monitoring Brain Metastases Background - Common malignancies: Lung (NSCLC), breast, kidney, colorectal carcinomas, and melanomas - Significantly more common than primary brain tumors - 80% of brain metastasis occur in the cerebrum at grey/white matter junction via hematogenous spread (smaller blood vessel diameter at the junction essentially traps tumor cells) Presentation - Highly variable: must consider brain mets in any cancer pt with neurologic or behavioral changes - Headache: worse in the mornings, with bending over or with Valsalva - Nausea/vomiting - Cognitive dysfunction: changes in memory, mood or personality - Neuro: focal neurologic deficits, seizures, stroke (particularly melanoma, choriocarcinoma, thyroid, and renal carcinomas) - Signs of elevated ICP: papilledema, vision changes, drowsiness, presyncope Evaluation - STAT CT if concerned for stroke or elevated ICP - MRI with contrast: most sensitive, can differentiate between metastases vs. other lesions * Suggestive features: multiple lesions, location, circumscribed margins, vasogenic edema, contrast enhancement - If pt has no known primary tumor: consider CT C/A/P \u00b1 PET to identify primary - Biopsy with histopathology and IHC: if diagnosis in doubt or if only a single lesion is present Management - If severe HA, N/V, focal neuro deficits: systemic glucocorticoids * Dexamethasone 10mg IV x1 followed by 4mg IV q6h (or PO if tolerated) - Stat/urgent consults: * Neurosurgery: diagnostic/therapeutic intervention. Note they will need a tissue diagnosis ASAP if not known; except in cases of emergency; affects operative plan. * Radiation oncology: will also need tissue diagnosis, and will have to coordinate with neurosurgery about timing of surgery versus radiation. Patient must be able to lie flat; they will need a CT simulation if radiation is to be offered. * Medical oncology: help with diagnosis and chemotherapy. Evolving systemic therapies can be effective for controlling metastatic disease to the brain, particularly with melanoma and NSCLC subtypes (ALK, EGFR) Ensure regular neuro-vascular checks and close monitoring Do not perform LP without input from neurology Paraneoplastic Syndromes Author: Bailey Decoursey, Justin Lo Hypercalcemia of Malignancy Background - Caused by PTHrP production, osteolytic lesions, and/or rarely exogenous Vit D * PTHrP: breast cancer, NSCLC (squamous) * Osteolysis: multiple myeloma, Breast Cancer; * Exogenous vit D: lymphoma Evaluation - Correct [Ca2+] for hypoalbuminemia: [Ca2+] + 0.8 x (4.0 \u2013 albumin) - Send basic hyperCa+2 work-up: PTH, vit D, etc (see \u201cHypercalcemia\u201d section) - PTHrP is called \u201cParathyroid Hormone-related Peptide-ARUP\u201d in Epic Management - First line: IVF without calcium such as Normosol; goal urinary output of 150-200 mL/hr * Strict I/Os: cautious IV fluids in pts with cardiac or renal dysfunction * Add Furosemide if hypervolemic (do not empirically start) - Second line: zoledronic acid 4mg IV (takes 24-48 hours to see effect) - AMS or severe hypercalcemia (>14mg/dL): calcitonin 4 IU/kg (requires attending approval) SIADH Background - Euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia with urine sodium >20 and typically urine Osm >100 - Associated with: SCLC (most common), head/neck cancers, breast cancer - See \"Hyponatremia\u201d section for additional information Management - Free water restriction to 800mL/day - Refractory: salt supplementation (e.g. salt tabs) \u00b1 loop diuretic Carcinoid Syndrome Background - Episodic flushing, diarrhea, wheezing/SOB due to secretion of histamine & serotonin - Most common: Neuroendocrine tumors, GI (often with mets to liver and lung) Evaluation - Urine: UR 5-HIAA (ARUP) - Imaging to identify tumor(s): CT C/A/P Management - Short-term treatment: subQ or IV octreotide (see UpToDate for dosing) - Antidiarrheals (Imodium, Lomotil) to slow transit - Long-term treatment: depot (IM) forms of octreotide and lanreotide - Refractory: Discuss with oncologist and PharmD about Telotristat Ethyl (inhibitor of tryptophan hydroxylase, FDA approved in combination with somatostatin analog (SSA) when SSA is not sufficient to control carcinoid symptoms). Autoimmune Encephalitis, Encephalomyelitis, and Myelitis Background - Encephalopathy (limbic or brainstem) \u00b1 myelitis (limb ataxia, sensory deficits) - Associated with small cell lung cancer and checkpoint inhibitor therapy Evaluation - LP: make sure to order CSF oligoclonal bands and CSF IgG index - \u201cParaneoplastic AutoAb Eval-MAYO\u201d (add \"CSF\" to the front of the order name if for LP) - NMDA-R can be ordered as a standalone test - CT head - EEG if concern for subclinical seizures Management - Consult Neurology for possible immunosuppressive therapy (steroids, IVIG) Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) Background - Muscle weakness due to autoantibody against calcium channels resulting in \u2193 ACh release - Associated with SCLC (most common) & lymphoma - See \u201cMyasthenia Gravis (MG) and Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS)\u201d section in Neurology Cancer of Unknown Primary Author: Bailey Decoursey Background - Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) accounts for 2% of all cancer diagnoses - Often, CUP is discovered incidentally on imaging tests or due to symptomatic metastasis Presentation - Asymptomatic and found on imaging - Often generalized fatigue and weight loss - May have irregular, persistent lymphadenopathy at a particular site Initial Evaluation - Physical exam: including pelvic / breast exam for females and prostate/testicular exam for males - CMP, CBC w/ diff, UA, PSA in males, fecal occult blood screening - CT C/A/P with contrast (reveals the origin in up to 35% of pts) - Once lesions are identified pt\u2019s should undergo biopsy of the most accessible lesion * If imaging is suggestive of GI origin, or pt has liver metastasis without other obvious dominant lesion, colonoscopy and/or upper EGD should be performed * If physical exam with breast abnormalities, or pt has axillary lymphadenopathy, bilateral mammography should be performed * Breast MRI may be considered even in the setting of negative mammography if clinical suspicion is high Evaluation following biopsy - Adenocarcinoma (70% of CUP) - Most common primary: pancreas, lung, liver, gastric, cholangiocarcinoma/HPB tree, and kidney - Interestingly, prostate and breast cancer account for a small percentage of CUP despite being the most common malignancies - Most common metastasis: liver, lungs, lymph nodes and bones - Evaluation: * Primary is most likely to be identified by biopsy * If clinical suspicion is high for certain primary site, this should be relayed to pathology so they may perform appropriate staining * Tissue PSA can be positive even in the setting of normal serum PSA * Serum studies such as CEA, CA19-9, AFP, CA 125, CA15-3 are often not sensitive or specific and will often be elevated in the setting of many types of adenocarcinoma; however it is still worth obtaining these for diagnostic workup. * Consider discussing with Oncology Fellow re: NGS molecular testing after biopsy, as occasionally finding somatic mutations from tumor specimens can help with identification of primary and guide management decisions. Neuroendocrine tumors (1% of CUP) High grade Most common primary: lung (bronchogenic) Most common metastasis: mediastinal and retroperitoneal LN Evaluation: CT of chest \u00b1 bronchoscopy will likely identify site If unrevealing, IHC staining and molecular cancer classifying assays will likely be helpful Squamous cell carcinoma (5% of CUP) Work up depends on the location of adenopathy as follows: Upper and mid-cervical lymphadenopathy Most common primary: head and neck cancer Evaluation: CT head and neck, direct laryngoscopy, nasopharyngoscopy Lower cervical/supraclavicular lymphadenopathy Most common primary: lung or head and neck Evaluation: CT chest, CT head and neck, direct laryngoscopy as indicated Inguinal lymphadenopathy Most common primary: genital or anorectal origin Evaluation Females: careful external and internal genital examination Males: close external genital examination Anoscopy and DRE in all pt - In up to 60% of cases, a primary site may never be identified \u2013 This is important for discussing with patients and families. - Empiric chemotherapy may be initiated in consultation with medical oncology Therapy Toxicities Author: Rahul Shah, AJ Winer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Toxicities Immune checkpoint inhibitors augment the endogenous immune response against tumors, which may lead to autoimmune-like toxicities, known as immune-related adverse events (irAEs) Treatment: low-dose glucocorticoids (prednisone, 0.5 mg/kg) for mild adverse events, high dose glucocorticoids (prednisone, 1-2 mg/kg) for severe adverse events. Depending on the irAE severity, future ICI therapy may be permanently discontinued. Adverse Event Type Incidence with anti-CTLA-4 (e.g. ipilimumab) Incidence with anti\u2010PD1/PD\u2010L1 (e.g. nivolumab, pembrolizumab) Skin (rash, pruritus, TEN) 30% 30% Colitis 25% 5% Hypothyroidism 20% 20% Hepatitis 10% 1% Hypophysitis 10% rare Pneumonitis 2-5% 2-5% Myocarditis \\<1% \\<1% Neurotoxicity (GBS, myasthenia gravis, encephalitis) \\<1% \\<1% Cytotoxic Agent Toxicities Class Agent Side Effect Alkylating agents busulfan pulmonary fibrosis or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage Alkylating agents cyclophosphamide myopericarditis, hemorrhagic cystitis (prevention: hydration; monitoring: daily UA, tx: mesna) Alkylating agents ifosfamide encephalopathy (tx: methylene blue), nephrotoxicity, hemorrhagic cystitis Antimetabolites 5- Fluorouracil (5-FU)/ Capecitabine (metabolized to FU) myelosuppression, coronary vasospasm, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, mucositis Antimetabolites cladribine, pentostatin dose reduced for CrCl Antimetabolites cytarabine (Ara-C) irreversible cerebellar ataxia (if high dose, neuro checks required), conjunctivitis (prevent with prophylactic steroid eye drops) Antimetabolites gemcitabine transient transaminitis, peripheral edema, rash, rarely: pulmonary toxicity, hemolytic uremic syndrome, capillary leak syndrome, PRES Antimetabolites methotrexate stomatitis, hepatotoxicity, renal failure, high dose requires leucovorin Antitumor antibiotics anthracyclines (doxorubicin, daunorubicin, idarubicin) HFrEF (need TTE prior).

Must have a tissue diagnosis prior to consultation - Is problem urgent? Clinic opens at 7:30am, so do not consult until after 7:30am unless emergent * Urgent conditions (Inpt consultation indicated, weekend treatment unlikely) * Rule of thumb: true emergencies (label consult, 'Urgent,' may treat even on a weekend) * Spinal cord compression * Airway collapse from mass effect * Life-threating hemorrhage from mass * Symptomatic brain mets (seizures, FND, ect) * Anaplastic thyroid cancer * Pain crisis from bone metastases * Requiring rapid turnaround: keloids (post-surgical for keloid prevention), heterotopic ossification) Everything else is generally treated outpt. Order an ambulatory referral for those pts. For pts whose outpt radiation gets interrupted by admission, no need for consult. Page Rad-Onc to close the loop. If in doubt, page Rad-Onc to discuss prior to placing consult. Have non-radiation interventions been discussed with the team/consultants first? Airway compromise: first consult IP/ENT for stent placement/trach Cord compression or symptomatic brain mets: consult Neurosurgery for possible intervention Spinal instability/pathologic fracture: calculate a Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS). If >6, consult Spine to assess for instability and surgical candidacy. They must have an attested note prior to radiation planning. Not that radiation helps with tumor pain but does not help with instability or pain from the fractures themselves. SVC syndrome: Consult IR for emergent percutaneous stent placement if 4_ points on Kishi scoring system. Engage Med Onc since chemo has a faster effect (especially in SLCL) than radiation (days). Consider surgical consult if concerned for thymoma Is the pt fit enough for radiation? Common precluding factors: Pt is too unstable Cannot lie flat or stay still for 10 min of treatment, 30min-45min for planning (delirium, dyspnea, uncontrolled pain, seizing) Head/neck radiation requires a facemask; claustrophobia should be addressed prior (benzos) Pre-consultation workup: Brain mets If symptomatic, dexamethasone 10mg IV load followed by 4mg q6 thereafter (with PPI). Rad onc can help with taper plan. Do not stop during active treatments. MRI with and without, labelled 'Cmelak Sequence' in comments section. May also be a 'For Radiation Planning' box. CSF sampling if suspicious of leptomeningeal spread DO NOT stop keppra If already onboard for seizures. Spine mets Damage becomes irreversible around 48 hours from symptom onset. Do not delay treatment and consultation (spine, rad onc, ect). STAT MRI with and without contrast. Dexamethasone 10mg IV load followed by 4mg q6 thereafter (with PPI). Rad onc can help with taper plan. Do not stop during active treatments. Logistical Considerations - Treatment planning takes several days to plan except in urgent/emergent circumstances. - Rad-Onc arranges ALL TRANSPORT for their pts. No need for primary team to do anything. - Pts must get a \u201cCT sim\u201d image in Rad-Onc department before starting any treatment. - Let Rad-Onc know if pts are going for other procedures/imaging on a treatment day, or if pt is refusing treatment. - Radiation plans cannot be transferred into or out of the Vanderbilt system. Let Rad-Onc know a few days in advance if transfers between Vanderbilt centers will be needed. - Pts cannot get radiation at 90% SNFs. Radiation must be completed prior to dispo. - Most CLCs do not transfer pts back and forth to radiation treatments, so if planning to discharge to CLC, radiation needs to be finished inpt or start after the CLC. - In general, most curative RT treatments take several weeks. Most palliative regimens take 1-10d. Radiation at the VA * - Pts need prior authorization before Rad-Onc is allowed to see VA pts at VUMC. To obtain PA, consult Med Onc and email Dr. York (medical oncologist at the VA). This may take a couple days. For Emergent cases, you do NOT have to wait on the PA. Rad-Onc can arrange for transport. - Rad-Onc attendings do not have access to the VA system. Notes will be in VUMC system. Radiation Toxicity Author: Jayden Gracie Radiation pneumonitis - 6 weeks to 6 months after RT to chest - Presents like pneumonia with cough and SOB, so need to rule out PNA - Imaging: chest X-ray or CT - Treatment: steroids Radiation dermatitis - Onset during or shortly after treatment - Variable: redness, dry desquamation (peeling, dry skin), or wet desquamation (blistering and oozing) - Treatment * Aquaphor or Aquaphor + lidocaine * Lidocaine can sometimes burn over wet desquamation. For wet desquamation (especially if looks potentially infected), start on Silvadene until it dries up.

Types of vWD - Type 1 (60-80% of cases): Partial deficiency of vWF. Levels are low, but protein works. - Type 2 (15-30% of cases): vWF is present but defective. There are subtypes: * 2A: vWF can\u2019t form large, effective multimers (chains) needed for platelet binding. * 2B: vWF binds too aggressively to platelets, causing them to clump and get cleared from circulation, reducing both vWF and platelets. * 2M: vWF has trouble binding to platelets due to a structural flaw. * 2N: vWF can\u2019t properly carry factor VIII, mimicking mild hemophilia A. - Type 3 (1-5% of cases): Severe.

Leukostasis is hyperleukocytosis + clinical symptoms of decreased tissue perfusion in end organs (CNS, lungs, heart, kidneys, etc). Typically manifests in leukemias (i.e. AML; Less common in CML/CLL unless there is a significant increase in peripheral blasts). Pathophysiology: Leukostasis is thought to be due to increased blood viscosity caused by a large population of leukemic blasts that are less deformable than mature leukocytes. As blasts increase in the blood, plugs of these more rigid cells form in the microcirculation and impede flow. The blast-endothelial cell interactions lead to endothelial cell damage, cytokine release, and subsequent hemorrhage and local hypoxemia within tissues, most notably the CNS and lungs. Presentation: - Common symptoms include: visual changes, headaches, dizziness, dyspnea, hypoxia, fever. Less common symptoms: abdominal pain, priapism, limb pain. Evaluation: - CBC w/ diff, peripheral blood smear, DIC and TLS labs - CT head to evaluate neuro deficit and to check for ICH - Chest X-Ray vs. CT chest to evaluate dyspnea and air space abnormalities - Note: PaO2 by ABG often falsely low from WBC consuming O2 in vitro.

Clinic opens at 7:30am, so do not consult until after 7:30am unless emergent * Urgent conditions (Inpt consultation indicated, weekend treatment unlikely) * Rule of thumb: true emergencies (label consult, 'Urgent,' may treat even on a weekend) * Spinal cord compression * Airway collapse from mass effect * Life-threating hemorrhage from mass * Symptomatic brain mets (seizures, FND, ect) * Anaplastic thyroid cancer * Pain crisis from bone metastases * Requiring rapid turnaround: keloids (post-surgical for keloid prevention), heterotopic ossification) Everything else is generally treated outpt. Order an ambulatory referral for those pts. For pts whose outpt radiation gets interrupted by admission, no need for consult. Page Rad-Onc to close the loop. If in doubt, page Rad-Onc to discuss prior to placing consult. Have non-radiation interventions been discussed with the team/consultants first? Airway compromise: first consult IP/ENT for stent placement/trach Cord compression or symptomatic brain mets: consult Neurosurgery for possible intervention Spinal instability/pathologic fracture: calculate a Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS). If >6, consult Spine to assess for instability and surgical candidacy. They must have an attested note prior to radiation planning. Not that radiation helps with tumor pain but does not help with instability or pain from the fractures themselves. SVC syndrome: Consult IR for emergent percutaneous stent placement if 4_ points on Kishi scoring system. Engage Med Onc since chemo has a faster effect (especially in SLCL) than radiation (days). Consider surgical consult if concerned for thymoma Is the pt fit enough for radiation? Common precluding factors: Pt is too unstable Cannot lie flat or stay still for 10 min of treatment, 30min-45min for planning (delirium, dyspnea, uncontrolled pain, seizing) Head/neck radiation requires a facemask; claustrophobia should be addressed prior (benzos) Pre-consultation workup: Brain mets If symptomatic, dexamethasone 10mg IV load followed by 4mg q6 thereafter (with PPI). Rad onc can help with taper plan. Do not stop during active treatments. MRI with and without, labelled 'Cmelak Sequence' in comments section. May also be a 'For Radiation Planning' box. CSF sampling if suspicious of leptomeningeal spread DO NOT stop keppra If already onboard for seizures. Spine mets Damage becomes irreversible around 48 hours from symptom onset. Do not delay treatment and consultation (spine, rad onc, ect). STAT MRI with and without contrast. Dexamethasone 10mg IV load followed by 4mg q6 thereafter (with PPI). Rad onc can help with taper plan. Do not stop during active treatments. Logistical Considerations - Treatment planning takes several days to plan except in urgent/emergent circumstances. - Rad-Onc arranges ALL TRANSPORT for their pts. No need for primary team to do anything. - Pts must get a \u201cCT sim\u201d image in Rad-Onc department before starting any treatment. - Let Rad-Onc know if pts are going for other procedures/imaging on a treatment day, or if pt is refusing treatment. - Radiation plans cannot be transferred into or out of the Vanderbilt system. Let Rad-Onc know a few days in advance if transfers between Vanderbilt centers will be needed. - Pts cannot get radiation at 90% SNFs. Radiation must be completed prior to dispo. - Most CLCs do not transfer pts back and forth to radiation treatments, so if planning to discharge to CLC, radiation needs to be finished inpt or start after the CLC. - In general, most curative RT treatments take several weeks. Most palliative regimens take 1-10d. Radiation at the VA * - Pts need prior authorization before Rad-Onc is allowed to see VA pts at VUMC. To obtain PA, consult Med Onc and email Dr. York (medical oncologist at the VA). This may take a couple days. For Emergent cases, you do NOT have to wait on the PA. Rad-Onc can arrange for transport. - Rad-Onc attendings do not have access to the VA system.

Discuss exception criteria with attending if suspect patient unlikely to survive hospitalization without transplant Note: Both living and deceased donor transplants are offered at VUMC. Donor evaluation, however, cannot be started before the potential recipient is deemed a candidate. Of note, should consider possible simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation for 1) CKD <30mL/min after > 90 days of eGFR<60 or 2) AKI dependent on dialysis >8 weeks or if extensive glomerulosclerosis present. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP) Author: Bailey DeCoursey Background Infection of ascitic fluid without evidence of a surgical intra-abdominal source Present in approximately 1/3 of patients with cirrhosis who are hospitalized Presentation: fever, abdominal pain, encephalopathy, renal failure, acidosis, and/or leukocytosis. However, up to one-third of the patients with spontaneous infections may be entirely asymptomatic or present with only encephalopathy and/or AKI Pathophysiology: Combination of GI bacterial flora overgrowth, reduced liver protein production (low complement levels), impaired phagocytic cell function leading to inability to clear pathogens Evaluation Any pt with cirrhosis and ascites who is admitted should have diagnostic para to r/o SBP. Delaying paracentesis > 12 hours is associated with a 2.7-fold increase in mortality. Obtain cell count with diff Calculate the PMNs: total nucleated cells x % neutrophils. PMN > 250 cells is diagnostic of SBP. If there are greater than 100k RBCs, you should correct for them: for every 250 RBCs, subtract 1 PMN A positive ascitic bacterial culture with PMN <250 is called bacterascites and asymptomatic patients with bacterascites should NOT receive antibiotics as it is likely a contaminant (however, repeat paracentesis should be performed to exclude progression to SBP). You will also frequently see culture-negative SBP (neutrocytic ascites) which SHOULD be treated (see below). Management Immediate Treatment: Immediately start empiric antibiotics Guidelines recommend cefotaxime IV 2gm q8 hours x 5 days, but we commonly use ceftriaxone IV 2g q24h for 5-7 days at VUMC and Nashville VA Most common culprits (E. coli, Klebsiella, streptococcal species, staphylococcal species) If SBP developed with recent hospital admission (90 days), recent exposure to BSA, diagnosed >48 hours of admission, or with sepsis, should give zosyn +/- vanc if prior infection or positive swab for MRSA. Daptomycin should be added with hx of VRE infection instead of vanc. Finally, in patients with current or recent exposure to zosyn consider meropenem for MDR coverage. IV albumin 1.5 g/kg on day 1 and 1g/kg on day 3 NSBB do not need to be discontinued in patients with SBP unless hypotensive (mean arterial pressure <65mmHg). If stopped, the timing of re-initiation is based on recovery of blood pressure PPI's \u2191 risk for SBP in pts with cirrhosis, and should be reviewed for appropriateness Repeat diagnostic paracentesis two days after antibiotics initiated If <25% decrease in PMNs, antibiotics should be broadened. Consider secondary bacterial peritonitis. Prophylaxis: Acute prophylaxis: Ciprofloxacin 500mg BID (preferred) or Bactrim one DS tablet BID x 5-7 days IV ceftriaxone 1g daily is currently the recommended antibiotic in patients with hemorrhage Outpatient lifelong prophylaxis: Prior SBP Ascitic protein <1.5 AND Child Pugh >9 and bilirubin >3 OR Renal dysfunction (Cr >1.2, Na <130, or BUN >25) Preferred: Bactrim DS tab daily or ciprofloxacin 500mg daily Alternatives: cefdinir 300mg daily, Augmentin 875/125 daily If suspicion is high for secondary bacterial peritonitis: Examine serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG). SBP develops in pts with portal hypertension, defined by SAAG > 1.1 g/dL. SBP is unlikely if SAAG is < 1.1 g/dL. While not particularly sensitive, an ascitic leukocyte count of 5-10k should prompt consideration of secondary peritonitis Amylase from fluid can also be helpful to point towards pancreatic ascites, while bilirubin can indicate gallbladder perforation. Peritoneal fluid CEA and alkaline phosphatase can additionally help identify hollow viscus injury. Evaluate with cross-sectional imaging and surgical consultation as appropriate Runyon's Criteria to distinguish, requires 2/3 criteria below (protein, glucose, LDH) Spontaneous Secondary Protein (g/dL) < 1 > 1 Glucose (mg/dL) \u226550 < 50 LDH (U) Elevated, but < 225 > 225 Organisms 0-1 Polymicrobial Gastroesophageal Varices and Hemorrhage Author: H. Anh Richardson Background Varices form due to portosystemic collaterals in the setting of portal HTN Gastroesophageal varices are present in approximately 50% of patients with cirrhosis and their presence correlates with severity of liver disease The risk of mortality with esophageal variceal hemorrhage (EVH) can be up to 15-20% Recurrence occurs in over 60% of patients within 1-2 years of the index event The most important predictor of hemorrhage is the size of the varices. Other predictors include decompensated cirrhosis (Child B/C) and endoscopic presence of red wale marks or red spots Variceal Screening: Regular screening not required in all patients with cirrhosis though initial EGD at time of cirrhosis diagnosis is recommended. Screening can be omitted in patients without evidence of clinically significant portal hypertension (low liver stiffness on elastography [LSM <20 and platelets >150], repeated TE annually) and in patients at low risk of bleed on NSBB. Compensated cirrhosis without varices: EGD q3yr Compensated cirrhosis with small varices that have not bled: EGD q2yr (unless on NSBB, then no need for follow-up EGD) Decompensated cirrhosis: EGD at time of decompensated and then q1yr Medium/large varices that have not bled: NSBB if tolerated (follow up surveillance EGD unnecessary) or EVL, repeated until obliterated with first surveillance EGD 1-3 months after and q 6-12 months to check for recurrence In general, most patients with cirrhosis should be on propranolol or carvedilol (preferred due to intrinsic anti-alpha-1-adrenergic activity and facilitates the release of nitric oxide, induces intrahepatic vasodilation further reducing portal pressure), per new guidelines. Always check with the hep attendings if BB needs to be started. Management (Non-Bleeding Varices) Primary ppx with either NSBB (preferred if tolerated; see table below) or endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL). EVL indicated in patients with high risk of bleeding (medium/large varices, small varices with red wale sign, or decompensated patients with varices of any size). Carvedilol has greater reduction in portal pressures and is preferred if tolerated (goal 6.25mg BID) Nadolol (given nightly as portal pressures are highest at night) or propranolol (BID) For secondary ppx, initiate ~72hr after acute bleed has resolved and octreotide discontinued Discontinue if: hypotension (SBP <90), AKI-HRS, SBP, or hyponatremia with refractory ascites Secondary ppx with both NSBB and EVL NSBB are associated with reduced mortality, while EVL is not Of note, in patients with clinically significant portal HTN but are without varices, there is no evidence to support the use of NSBB to prevent varices formation, but high-level evidence does support use of NSBB (strongest evidence for Carvedilol) in prevention of any decompensation (ascites, variceal hemorrhage, HE) and has a mortality benefit (likely driven by significant reduction in ascites development) Management (Bleeding Varices) Place two large-bore IVs (18G or larger), resuscitate with blood products and albumin. Activate massive transfusion protocol if needed. Consider intubation if need for emergent EGD, change in mental status, ongoing hematemesis, or inability to protect airway Start octreotide 50 mcg IV bolus followed by continuous infusion of 50 mcg/h, to be continued for at 2-5 days should EVH be confirmed on endoscopy Ceftriaxone 1g IV q24h for SBP prophylaxis (reduced mortality), then transition to PO ciprofloxacin for total 7-day course Consult GI for upper endoscopy for possible EVL vs sclerotherapy. EGD should be performed within 12 hours of admission. Consider balloon tamponade with Blakemore as temporizing measure before definitive management. Patient must be intubated before placement, and preferably GI should be made aware prior to placement. No role for the correction of INR, even in the presence of bleeding as excessive blood products and FFP can increase portal pressures and cause worsening bleeding Vitamin K can be given w/ \u2191 INR, though is unlikely to help in the acute setting Check TEG and fibrinogen and transfuse based on results AASLD does not recommend specific platelet targets during variceal hemorrhage Administer blood products in balanced ratio to avoid transfusion related coagulopathy Beta-Blocker Dosing Table Therapy MOA Starting dose Titration Max dose Goal Propranolol Decreased cardiac output; caused by decreased heart rate and contractility from beta-1 adrenergic blockade 20\u201340 mg twice daily Increase the dose every 2\u20133 d until treatment goal Without ascites: 320 mg/day; with ascites: 160 mg/day HR of 55\u201360 bpm if tolerated; SBP should be maintained \u226590 mm Hg Nadolol Above plus Splanchnic arterial vasoconstriction; caused by beta-2 blockade leading to unopposed alfa-adrenergic vasoconstriction 20\u201340 mg at bedtime Increase the dose every 2\u20133 d until treatment goal Without ascites: 160 mg/day; with ascites: 80 mg/day HR of 55\u201360 bpm if tolerated; SBP should be maintained \u226590 mm Hg Carvedilol Above plus decreased intrahepatic vascular resistance; caused by anti-alpha-adrenergic activity 6.25 mg once daily Increase to 6.25 mg twice daily after 3 d 12.5 mg/day (higher doses could be considered for non-hepatic indications) No HR goal; SBP should be maintained \u226590 mm Hg Ascites and Hepatic Hydrothorax Author: Thomas Strobel Ascites Background Associated with a reduction in 5-year survival from 80% to 30%. Most often due to portal HTN. Less common causes include peritoneal or metastatic cancer, CHF, TB, nephrotic syndrome, Budd-Chiari, sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (S.O.S), or complications from procedures and pancreatitis Grade Definition Treatment Grade 1 Ascites Only seen on imaging 2g Na restriction Grade 2 Ascites Moderate, symmetric abdominal distension 2g Na restriction, diuretics Grade 3 Ascites Marked, tense abdominal distension LVP + Na restriction, diuretics (unless refractory) Evaluation Bedside ultrasound on admission to confirm presence of ascites Diagnostic paracentesis in all pts with ascites on admission mainly to rule out occult SBP Initial paracentesis or when cause of ascites is uncertain: ascitic fluid total protein, serum and BF Albumin, cell count w/diff, culture Subsequent/Serial paracenteses: cell count w/diff, culture, protein Always inoculate culture bottles at bedside Per AASLD guidelines elevated INR and thrombocytopenia (<50K) are not contraindications for paracentesis. Additionally, administration of clotting factors or platelets is not recommended. However, practically our procedure team often looks for INR < 3.5 (IR usually does not care about INR) Serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) = serum albumin - ascites albumin. Total Protein Ascites (not serum) SAAG \u22651.1 g/dL (Portal HTN) SAAG < 1.1 g/dL (Non-portal HTN) < 2.5 g/dL Cirrhosis Nephrotic Syndrome, Myxedema \u22652.5 g/dL Post-hepatic portal HTN: Cardiac Ascites, Budd-Chiari Malignant Ascites, Pancreatic Ascites, TB Other tests: Triglycerides: if fluid is milky Cytology: if very concerned for peritoneal carcinomatosis. May need up to 3 separate samples (50ml or more) to be able to detect malignant cells ADA: if concern for peritoneal TB Hematocrit: For bloody appearing fluid (not just serosanguinous) to rule out hemoperitoneum. There needs to be a recent serum HCT for comparison. Amylase: If concerned for pancreatic ascites Glucose, LDH if concern about secondary peritonitis Management 2000mg sodium restriction per day for all ascites (Grade 1-3) Diuretics (spironolactone and typically furosemide) Start at 100mg of spironolactone with up titration to 400mg Furosemide is added if insufficient diuresis or if limited by hyperkalemia. Use more loop diuretics in patients with CKD. If Urine Na:K ratio <1, indicates insufficient natriuresis. Can \u2191 doses to a max of 400:160 If poor response can change to torsemide 10mg and \u2191 to 40mg max (per single dose) Fluid restriction usually not necessary unless serum sodium <125 mmol/L Large volume paracentesis should be performed for tense ascites regardless of serum Cr. Pts with tense ascites should be tapped dry with each paracentesis (per EASL) and may consider an upper limit of 8 L (per AASLD, based on one study) Give 6-8g of albumin per liter of ascites removed, even if < 5L Target weight loss of 0.5 kg/day when diuresing to avoid renal injury Discontinue NSAIDs and ACEI/ARB Refractory Ascites: Two distinctions: - Diuretic-resistant: lack of response to diuretics (max spironolactone 400mg/Lasix 160mg), Na restriction and rapid recurrence following paracentesis - Diuretic-intractable: unable to tolerate diuretic therapy due to adverse drug effects (unexplained HE, AKI, K abnormalities, hypoNa, intractable muscle cramps) Management aside from liver transplant: - Discontinue diuretics once refractory ascites has been established, but continue Na dietary restriction - Consider oral midodrine; can be especially helpful if pt is also hypotensive - Serial paracenteses, generally arranged OP with IR - Consider TIPS (trans jugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt; has survival benefit) for refractory ascites or recurrent ascites (>3 LVPs in one year despite compliance with diet and diuretics). Following TIPS, cessation or decrease in ascites should occur in ~6 weeks - Consider discontinuing beta blockers in patients with refractory ascites if sBP <90, SCr >1.5, or Na <130 Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) Author: Ahmad Yanis Classifications of HE: Type A: in patients with acute liver failure Type B: in patients with portosystemic shunt without significant liver disease Type C: in patients with cirrhosis Covert HE: minor or no signs/symptoms but abnormalities on neuropsychological and/or neurophysiological tests Overt HE: Clinically appreciable change In mental status (e.g., AxOx2 or asterixis) recurrent (\u2265 2 bouts) within 6 months Persistent: if the patient does not return to their baseline performance between bouts. Evaluation Asterixis: inability to maintain stable posture; many ways to assess Check for clonus Have pt \"hold out hands like you are stopping traffic\" (if following commands) Shine light in pupil (look up video of hippus) Grading Scale: Grade Behavior Change I Mild confusion, changes in behavior, increased sleep, no asterixis, cannot be confirmed without neuropsych testing II Moderate confusion, lethargic, AAOx2, +asterixis III Marked confusion, arousable but falls asleep, incoherent speech, AAOx1, +asterixis IV Coma Identify precipitants: Infection (rule out SBP in addition to CXR, BCx, UA/Cx) Medication non-adherence (lactulose) GI bleed (perform rectal exam and observe Hgb trend) Over-diuresis resulting in dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities (especially hypoK) Sedatives/benzo/opiate administration (UDS) Brain imaging does not provide any diagnostic value for HE but may be utilized if diagnostic uncertainty exists Increased ammonia (NH3) levels do not add any diagnostic, staging, or prognostic value in patients with CLD. A normal ammonia level, however, calls for diagnostic re-evaluation Arterial NH3 is used in acute liver failure for prognostication (not for management) Management Always determine precipitant and treat underlying condition Lactulose 30mL TID initially titrated to 2-3 BMs/D as secondary prophylaxis after the management of first episode of overt HE. Titrate dose to at least 4 BMs daily, avoid excessive stool output which may exacerbate HE d/t dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities Consider lactulose enemas vs DHT placement if pt unable to tolerate PO DHT are not contraindicated in patients with esophageal varices, but should be avoided in patients with recent hemorrhage or banding Add Rifaximin after the second episode of HE, or if failure to respond to lactulose Frequently requires prior authorization for outpatient approval and is expensive Consider the addition of golytely as it has been found in RCTs to expedite resolution of severe HE by 1 day Lactulose is generally continued indefinitely after first episode of HE, though discontinuation can be considered on an individual basis if predisposing factors (recurrent infection, EVH, EtOH use) have resolved, improvement in liver function, and improvement in nutritional status For patients with chronic diarrhea off lactulose, consider adding BCAA (0.25 gm/kg/d) AKI & Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS) Author: Garren Montgomery Background Portal HTN causes shear stress on portal vessels \u2192 endothelium release of vasodilators \u2192 splanchnic vasodilation and reduced effective blood volume (decreased MAP) \u2192 RAAS activation \u2192 sodium and water retention and severe renal vasoconstriction Bacterial translocation (as seen in SBP) increased circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines \u2192 splanchnic vasodilation Definitions: HRS-AKI (formerly type I HRS): Rise in Cr \u22650.3 within 48h, rise in Cr \u226550% within 7 days, OR UOP <0.5 mL/kg/hr for 6 hours HRS-NAKI (\"non-AKI\") (formerly type II HRS): HRS-AKD: eGFR<60 for <3 months in absence of other structural causes OR % rise in Cr \u226450% using last available Cr over last 3 months as baseline HRS-CKD: eGFR<60 for \u22653 months in absence of other structural causes Diagnostic Criteria: Diagnosis of AKI (see above) without other cause (see below) No response or inadequate response at 48 hrs after volume expansion with albumin (1g/kg/day) and withdrawal of diuretics Absence of proteinuria (<500 mg/d), absence of hematuria (<50 RBCs per HPF), normal renal ultrasound (exclude if patient has known CKD) Suggestion of renal vasoconstriction with FeNa <0.2, FeUrea <20 (most sensitive diagnostic measure). UNa <20 is suggestive but not diagnostic given baseline sodium avidity in cirrhosis and inability to calculate FeNa. If UNa Is <20, FeNa cannot be calculated. Cut off for ATN in cirrhosis is a FeNa >0.5, rather than 1 in the general population Evaluation Step 1: Exclude other obvious causes of renal injury such as hypovolemia or ATN Common precipitants of AKI: infection, over diuresis, GI bleeding, recent LVP without subsequent volume expansion, nephrotoxic drugs/NSAIDs Workup: BMP, UA with microscopy, urine electrolytes (FeNa, FeUrea), urine protein/Cr ratio, renal ultrasound (to assess for chronicity), diagnostic para to rule out SBP Step 2: Diuretic cessation/albumin challenge STOP all diuretics, beta blockers, NSAIDs, ACE/ARBs, anti-hypertensives, vasodilators, nephrotoxins START volume expansion with albumin 1g/kg/day (up to a max of 100 g/day) x2 days Step 3: Diagnosis of HRS If no other clear cause of AKI is identified and SCr has not improved after 48 hours of diuretic cessation and volume expansion, proceed promptly to vasopressor treatment Management Pharmacologic therapies (in order of preference): Terlipressin (+/- albumin 50g/day, unless there is evidence of volume overload). Most effective medication based on randomized clinical trials, NOW FDA APPROVED and approved for use at VUMC in Transplant Candidates only. Titration is done based on creatinine response. Alternatively, consider Norepinephrine (+/- albumin 50 g/day) Requires central access (PICC vs triple lumen) but can be administered on stepdown unit Guidelines recommend NE to be dosed at 0.5-3 mg/hr. Would ask fellow, attending or pharmacist for baseline. VUMC protocol for ICU and stepdown: Start NE gtt at 3mcg/min. If UOP is <200 or MAP <10mm Hg from baseline, increase by 3 mcg/min every 4 hours Continue to hold diuretics. LVP is still generally considered safe even in HRS if indicated by tense ascites (account for albumin repletion from LVP and HRS protocol). This can be attending specific and would confirm prior to performing Therapy is generally continued until HRS is reversed or the hepatology attending deems it refractory to medical treatment. (Per guidelines, protocol normally discontinued if Cr remains at pretreatment level or above >4 days) Patients with HRS-NAKI (formerly type II HRS) may respond to the above therapies, but recurrence of renal dysfunction after withdrawal of vasoconstrictors is the norm and thus current guidelines do not recommend them for this scenario RRT: Dialysis can be considered for those who fail to respond to pharmacologic therapy, particularly as a bridge to liver transplant. Decision to initiate should be individualized Liver transplant: The best and most definitive treatment regardless of response to pharmacologic therapy Simultaneous liver-kidney transplant: HRS often resolves with LT alone. Indications for kidney transplant are usually for patients with severe chronic renal dysfunction or on RRT. Must consult transplant nephrology. Criteria for SLKT: - eGFR <60 for >30 days AND latest eGFR <30 - eGFR <25 for >6 consecutive weeks with a documented eGFR q7 days - Metabolic kidney disease and polycystic disease Can qualify for safety net kidney transplant after liver transplant if eGFR <20 2-12 months post-operatively (would be at higher priority than the rest of the kidney transplant list) Hyponatremia in Cirrhosis Author: Kinsley Ojukwu Background Hyponatremia in cirrhosis is often defined as serum Na < 135 mmol/L Very common problem; prevalence: ~50% of individuals have serum < 135 mmol/L, ~22% < 130 mmol/L Degree of hyponatremia is associated with progression of cirrhosis; patients with hypona have greater incidence of HE, SBP, and HRS, increased complications & mortality pre/post-tx. Patients most commonly have hypervolemic (dilutional) hypona. Pathophysiology Hypovolemic hyponatremia: 2/2 excessive diuretic use Hypervolemic hyponatremia: Advanced cirrhosis \u2192 chronic inflammation and fibrosis in liver \u2192 increased resistance to portal flow \u2192 portal hypertension \u2192 release of vasoactive compounds (primarily nitric oxide) \u2192 splanchnic arterial vasodilation \u2192 reduced effective arterial blood volume (splanchnic veins contain 20% to 50% of the total blood volume) \u2192 reduced effective intravascular volume leads to activation of RAAS + ADH + sympathetic nervous system \u2192 RAAS encourages Na retention and ADH causes insertion of aquaporins in distal tubule and collecting duct to increase water reabsorption \u2192 dilutional (hypervolemic) hyponatremia Evaluation Uosm, Sosm, UNa to rule out competing processes (e.g. beer potomania) Management Do not correct Na faster than 6-8mEq/L in 24 hours Discontinue anti-hypertensives (including beta blockers) in patients with ascites and hypona. Hold diuretics when Na <125 Fluid restriction is recommended only in patients with Na <125. Restriction is generally effective at 1-1.5L and must be less than daily UOP to increase free water excretion Replete K to 4.0 25% albumin infusion (1g/kg split into BID dosing), has been shown to increase serum Na and have higher rates of hypona resolution at 30 days Treatment considerations include vasopressors, urea tabs Vaptans are generally not used in clinical practice given recent RCTs showing harm with use Salt tabs should not be used to raise serum Na due to worsening hypervolemia Nephrology should be consulted if not improved after 48 hours Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) Author: Ahmad Yanis Background A TIPS procedure is done by IR to manage sequalae of portal HTN (specifically variceal bleeding and ascites) A low-resistance shunt is created between an intrahepatic branch of the portal vein and the hepatic vein, allowing blood to bypass the high-resistance vessels within the fibrotic liver. Ideally, creating the smallest-necessary caliber shunt is desirable. Recent studies suggest that an 8-mm-diameter PTFE-lined TIPS may be sufficient to prevent variceal rebleeding and potentially decrease the incidence of hepatic encephalopathy Evaluation Indications for TIPS: Variceal hemorrhage (esophageal, gastric, etc.) Early \"preemptive\" TIPS is an urgent TIPS placement within 72 hrs (preferably within 24 hours) of initial endoscopic hemostasis in pts at high risk for rebleeding (Child-Pugh Class B with active bleeding upon insertion of endoscope or Child-Pugh Class C with recent bleeding \"Rescue\" TIPS is placed in pts with active, uncontrolled variceal bleeding or if bleeding recurs despite maximal endoscopic and pharmacologic therapy Refractory ascites (prolongs survival) Other: bleeding portal hypertensive gastropathy, bleeding gastric varices, PVT recanalization, Budd-Chiari syndrome, hepatic hydrothorax Contraindications to TIPS: Absolute contraindications: - Primary prevention of variceal bleeding, congestive heart failure, severe tricuspid regurgitation, severe pulmonary hypertension, multiple hepatic cysts or masses, Sepsis, unrelieved biliary obstruction Relative contraindications: - Hepatic encephalopathy, hepatic tumors (especially if centrally located), thrombocytopenia (<20k), moderate pulmonary hypertension Pre-procedure preparation: Labs: CBC, CMP, INR Liver imaging to assess portal system patency and exclude liver masses Ideally triple phase CT with contrast In pts with renal impairment or active variceal bleeding, RUQ U/S with doppler is acceptable TTE to evaluate for evidence of congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, or valvular disease. Antibiotic ppx with ceftriaxone 1g IV once at the time of TIPS insertion as enteric bacteria within the static portal system can enter systemic circulation Patients with HE should receive rifaximin prophylaxis starting 2 weeks before procedure and maintained for at least 6 months after the procedure Management Post-TIPS Immediately following TIPS, pts are observed in the hospital overnight for complications Monitor CBC and vitals closely. If hemodynamically unstable, STAT CBC and low threshold to obtain CTA A/P to evaluate for a bleeding source TIPS causes a substantial increase in venous return to the heart, which can unmask cardiac dysfunction that was previously compensated for Obtain RUQ U/S with Doppler to assess shunt patency 1 month of TIPS placement, or if ascites and/or variceal hemorrhage reoccur If patient with a TIPS develops refractory HE, can consider TIPS revision to lessen HE symptoms Clearance of ascites is not immediate post-TIPS (may take 6-12 weeks), and patients should be maintained on a sodium-restricted diet and diuretics until ascites is adequately controlled. Hemodynamic Pressure Measurements and Goals: The HVPG refers to the difference in intravascular pressure between the portal vein and the hepatic vein. During TIPS placement, direct portal pressures are measured and used to calculate the portosystemic pressure gradient (PSPG) In patients with acute, uncontrolled esophageal variceal bleeding, the desired post-TIPS PSPG is <12 mm Hg or, If the former is not feasible, a reduction \u226550% from baseline PSPG The desired PSPG for secondary prevention of gastroesophageal variceal bleeding is <12 mm Hg In patients not achieving a PSPG <12 mm Hg despite dilation of the stent to a maximum 10 mm of diameter, the addition of nonselective beta-blockers (NSBBs) should be considered Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Author: Julie Cui Background Fifth most common tumor and the second most common cause of cancer related death worldwide The incidence in patients with cirrhosis is 2-4% per year In chronic HBV and NASH, pts can develop HCC without having cirrhosis Evaluation Regular screening in pts with cirrhosis (or chronic HBV without cirrhosis) for HCC RUQ U/S q6mo (with or without AFP) Routine screening with CT or MRI is not recommended Options If U/S not satisfactory: CT A/P w/contrast, in comments specify triple phase for HCC screening MRI, specify Gadovist (preferred contrast agent) Contrast-enhanced ultrasound AFP trend is more useful than one value in time, though AFP >20 should prompt multiphase CT or MRI for further evaluation Diagnosis can be made either by imaging (most common) or biopsy (rare) Triple phase CT demonstrates strong early uptake in arterial phase, with subsequent wash-out in portal-venous phase If diagnosis remains unclear: can surveillance imaging or biopsy LI-RADS system notes risk of malignancy based on imaging characteristics LI-RADS Classification: LI-RADS What does it mean? What do we do? LR-1 to LR-2 Definitely/probably benign Routine surveillance, consider diagnostic imaging within 6 mos LR-3 to LR-4 Indeterminate/probably HCC Repeat or alternative diagnostic imaging in 3-6 mos. Consider Bx for LI-RADS 4 LR-5 Definitely HCC Plan treatment as noted below LR-M Cancer, but may not be HCC Management Lesions that meet Milan criteria can qualify for MELD exception points and are considered transplant candidates This accounts for pts with minimal synthetic dysfunction (and therefore low MELD) Milan criteria: Single tumor with diameter >2cm but <5 cm, no more than 3 tumors, each <3 cm No signs of extra-hepatic involvement or vascular invasion Liver transplant is definitive treatment, although resection can also be curative (favored in pts with early cirrhosis i.e. Child Pugh A) Locoregional therapies: Pts with unresectable disease, or who are not surgical candidates Therapy Details Radiofrequency ablation If in a favorable location and size, IR can percutaneously ablate with a large needle that emits microwave frequencies Trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) Chemotherapeutic agents injected into the tumor to occlude the feeding artery to the area. Trans-arterial radioembolization (TARE) Like TACE, though radioactive compound (i.e. Y-90) is Injected In the the feeding artery Stereotactic body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) Radiation therapy: can be used as an alternative to ablation or trans-arterial therapy Systemic Chemotherapy For metastatic disease Coagulopathy in Cirrhosis Author: John Laurenzano Background The liver is responsible for production of both pro- (factor II, V, VII, IV, X, and XI) and anti-coagulants (protein C, S) in hemostasis. Factor VIII is the only one not made by the liver. Thrombocytopenia is caused by splenic sequestration from portal HTN, failure to produce thrombopoietin (TPO), and bone marrow failure Hemostatic changes in cirrhotics are incredibly complex, as they involve both procoagulant and anticoagulants. The current thought is that cirrhosis is NO LONGER considered a condition associated with an overall increased bleeding tendency, as the pro-hemostatic and anti-hemostatic pathways are deranged in a way that counterbalance each other. Evaluation INR/PT, and PTT are poorly reflective of bleeding risk Management Pre-procedural FFP is not recommended, as it has potential harm w/o proven benefit Low risk procedures (i.e., paracentesis) do not require pre-procedural blood products and per guidelines there is no established INR or platelet cut off In bleeding pts, the following are recommended per AASLD and AGA guidelines IV Vitamin K 10mg x 3 days FFP: Not recommended, unless as part of a balanced transfusion effort to avoid transfusion related coagulopathy, or if a TEG screen suggests potential benefit Cryoprecipitate: if fibrinogen < 120 Platelets: No specific targets regardless of bleeding. Pre-procedurally, recommend >50 Appropriate DVT ppx should be given with few exceptions (plts <50k, active hemorrhage) For TEG transfusion recommendations are as follows: 10 mg/kg FFP if R-time >10 minutes 1u Plts if maximum amplitude <55 mm 5u cryo if alpha angle <45 Portal Vein Thrombosis (PVT) Author: Pakinam Mekki Background Portal Vein Thrombosis (PVT) can worsen decompensation (i.e. variceal hemorrhage), however, worsening portal HTN \u2192 more sluggish flow \u2192 increased risk PVT Presentation Often identified asymptomatically on U/S, but can be identified by new or worsening decompensation of portal HTN Variceal hemorrhage is the most common decompensating event associated with PVT Intestinal ischemia (abdominal pain, hematochezia) from PVT is exceedingly rare but associated with significant morbidity/mortality Evaluation RUQ U/S with doppler Once identified, should be further assessed with triple phase CT or MRI with Gadovist contrast to exclude HCC with tumor thrombus Pts with newly identified PVT should undergo EGD to evaluate for high-risk varices, both for diagnostic and therapeutic considerations PVT in pts without cirrhosis should prompt evaluation for hypercoagulable disorders Management Start AC if acute thrombus occludes >50% of main portal vein, <50% but extends into SMV, thrombus is symptomatic, or patient is a transplant candidate (irrespective of size). Requires discussion with attending/transplant team. AC options: warfarin, LMWH, or DOAC DOAC's are safe in Childs Class A, can be used with caution in Childs B, and are contraindicated in Childs C Pts with chronic occlusive PVT (>6 mos) or with cavernous transformation with collaterals do not generally benefit from AC Pts with high-risk varices should undergo endoscopic management or be on NSBB for prophylaxis for variceal hemorrhage, as noted above TIPS with portal vein recanalization has recently emerged as a therapeutic modality for PVT in LT candidates to allow for anastomosis, in patient's with chronic PVT and recurrent bleeding/refractory ascites, or in patients whom intestinal ischemia persists despite AC. Pts should undergo follow up intermittently with US to assess for recanalization. AC may be stopped if there is failure to recanalize. If pts are not candidates for AC, they'll simply be treated for complications of portal HTN Alcohol-associated Hepatitis Author: Ahmad Yanis Background Acute onset of rapidly progressive jaundice (within prior 8 weeks) in pt with heavy EtOH intake (>40g in females or >60g in males EtOH/day for >6 mos, or within <60 days of abstinence) May present after they have quit drinking due to immunosuppressive effects of alcohol Risk Factors: Female, Hispanic ethnicity, binge drinking, poor nutrition, and obesity Evaluation AST >60, AST/ALT >1.5, both values <400 IU/L; TBili >3.0 mg/dL, documentation of heavy EtOH use until 8 weeks prior to presentation (some guidelines state 12 weeks) Prognostication with Maddrey's Discriminant Function: 4.6 * (PTpt \u2013 PTctrl) + Tbili Maddrey > 32 or MELD > 20 = poor 30d prognosis & may benefit from steroids (see below) RUQ U/S to rule out obstructive cause of jaundice Biopsy is not typically required but will show neutrophilic lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, steatosis, and pericellular fibrosis. Phosphatidylethanol (PEth) level is a biomarker of ethanol consumption over ~ 4wks; >20 ng/mL can indicate chronic moderate/heavy alcohol intake A single episode consumption can result in detectable Peth for up to 12 days. Can be elevated for months with regular heavy alcohol intake EtOH levels may be negative unless acutely intoxicated Management Supportive Care is essential! Consult nutrition, start high protein, high calorie diet, high dose Thiamine x 3d, Folate, MVI Full infection workup (CXR, UA, BCx, paracentesis) regardless of symptoms Steroids: Discuss with hepatology team, >20 clinical trials conducted with inconsistent results Largest trial was the STOP-AH Trial (NEJM 2015) which showed improved mortality at 28 days in post hoc analysis, but not at 90 days in patients with Maddrey > 32. VA trial (patients with MDF >54) showed increased mortality, indicating a possible ceiling at which point steroids may be harmful. Individuals with a neutrophil: lymphocyte ratio of 5-8 are most likely to benefit from steroid use. Treatment dose is prednisolone 40mg daily (preferred over prednisone as it requires hepatic metabolism) Contraindications to steroids include: presence of infection (must rule out first including TB, active Hep B, sepsis, uncontrolled GI bleeding, AKI w/ Cr >2.5 mg/dL) The Lille score can be used to assess response to steroids after 7 d of therapy and prognosticate mortality at 6 months Lille> 0.45 indicates no response to steroids and predicts 75% mortality at 6 months NAC should be considered as adjunctive therapy to steroids Monitor on CIWA Psychiatry consultation as appropriate, consideration of medical therapy (see \"Substance Use Disorders\" section in psychiatry) MASH and MASLD Author: Shabnam Eghbali Background Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) presence of hepatic steatosis (>5% of hepatocytes with macro-vesicular steatosis) in the absence of secondary causes (e.g, EtOH or HCV GT3) and at least one of five of the below criteria: BMI \u2265 25 OR waist circumference > 94 cm (M) / 80 cm (F) Fasting serum glucose \u2265 100 OR 2-hr post-load glucose levels \u2265 140 OR HgbA1c \u2265 5.7% OR T2DM Blood pressure \u2265 130/85 OR on anti-hypertensive medication Plasma triglycerides \u2265 150 OR on lipid lowering treatment Plasma HDL \u2264 40 (M) / 50 (F) OR on lipid lowering treatment Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) evidence of active inflammation and cellular injury +/- fibrosis Strong association with metabolic syndrome, T2DM, HTN, obesity Prevalence of MASLD is 25-30% in general population and is now the leading cause of transplantation in American women Presentation: MASLD is asymptomatic and frequently found incidentally via imaging MASH manifests with elevated liver enzymes, typically 2-5x the ULN, in a roughly 1:1 ratio (as opposed to alcoholic steatohepatitis), though ALT may be higher than AST. MASLD or MASH does NOT cause RUQ pain. Patients can still have normal liver enzymes with MASLD or MASH. Evaluation Exclusion of alternative causes and comorbid liver conditions: HCV, HBV, EtOH, etc. Screen for comorbid metabolic disorders: Lipid panel, hemoglobin a1c Primary risk assessment with FIB-4 (see NITs section) Diagnosis commonly made via imaging US is used most frequently, although conventional B mode US lacks sensitivity for lower degrees of steatosis. As a result, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) on VCTE (Ie FibroScan) is commonly used. MRI is also acceptable. MRI-proton density fat fraction is a precise method for liver fat quantification (available for clinical care at VUMC) Liver biopsy should be considered when non-invasive testing suggests significant fibrosis (\u2265F2) Management Aggressive risk factor modification and management of comorbidities (HLD, HTN, T2DM) Weight loss: Mediterranean diet>low fat diet (dose dependent improvement), increased coffee consumption is associated with less progression of liver disease MASLD (fat only) Weight Loss Goal: > 5% of body weight MASH (fat and inflammation) Weight Loss Goal: >10% of body weight Consider referral to weight loss clinic (BMI >40, or >35 with metabolic comorbidities) Once the patient is diagnosed with MASLD, evaluation for fibrosis is indicated Fibrosis-4 (FIB 4) score: First line assessment. Assesses probability of fibrosis. Elastography: More accurate can be vibration based (fibroscan), US based (sheer-wave), or MR-based. Available at VUMC and can be ordered by anyone. Insurance will not cover MRE if BMI <35 Fibroscan: <10kPa r/o advanced chronic liver disease (fibrosis); 10-15kPa are suggestive of advanced chronic liver disease; >15kPa are highly suggestive. Encourage etoh cessation; contributes to fatty liver disease progression FDA recently approved Rezdiffra (resmetirom) for the treatment of adults with noncirrhotic MASLD with moderate to advanced liver scarring (fibrosis), to be used along with diet and exercise SGLT2 Inhibitors: May reduce steatosis in patients with MASLD+ DM Vitamin E: Can improve steatosis and inflammation in the setting of biopsy-proven MASH with evidence of hepatic fibrosis (fibrosis score 2+) in patients w/o DM GLP-1 agonists: Consider for patients with MASH+DM/obesity as it confers cardiovascular benefit and improves steatosis but probably not fibrosis GLP-1/GIP agonist (e.g, semaglutide) Tirzepatide): Can reduce steatosis. Can be use in patients with DM or obesity + NAFLD Metformin, DPP4, statins, and silymarin are well studied in MASH and do not offer meaningful histologic benefit In the pipeline: FGF21 agonists, THR beta agonists, PPAR agonists Additional Information Statins: should be used for HLD in pts with MASH, MASLD, and MASH cirrhosis Statin use in decompensated MNASH cirrhosis is controversial, and they are less likely to derive benefit given overall poor prognosis, discontinue w/acute on chronic liver failure. Acute Liver Injury and Failure Author: Wrinn Alexander Background Acute liver injury (ALI): elevated liver enzymes + INR \u22651.5 without encephalopathy Acute liver failure (ALF): elevated liver enzymes + encephalopathy (any degree of AMS or asterixis) in the absence of pre-existing liver disease* *Autoimmune hepatitis, HBV, Wilson disease, and Budd-Chiari syndrome can have ALF if they develop new AMS, despite the presence of a pre-existing liver disease Hyperacute (< 7 d): most often seen with acetaminophen toxicity, Hepatitis A & E, Ischemic; high risk for cerebral edema Acute (7-21 d): Hepatitis B Subacute (> 21 d and < 26 wk): most often non-acetaminophen DILI Alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) is not ALF (see above) Duration of <26 weeks is a commonly used cut-off Etiology R-factor (if history, exam, and diagnostic data are inconclusive i.e. R-factor is not a replacement to clinical judgement) = (ALT/uln ALT) / (ALP/uln ALP); See chart below - R > 5 = hepatocellular injury; R<2 = cholestatic injury; R 2-5 = mixed injury Isolated hyperbilirubinemia: Differentiate direct versus indirect - Direct: Refer to cholestatic pattern - Indirect: Gilbert vs. hemolysis Drugs Associated with liver injury: Hepatocellular pattern: acarbose, Acetaminophen, Allopurinol, Amiodarone, Baclofen, Bupropion, Fluoxetine, HAART (Nevirapine), Kava kava, Isoniazid, Ketoconazole, Lisinopril, Losartan, Methotrexate, NSAIDs, Omeprazole, Oxacillin/Nafcillin, Paroxetine, Pyrazinamide, Propylthiouracil, Rifampin, Risperidone, Sertraline, Statins, Tetracycline, Trazodone, Valproic Acid Mixed pattern: Amitriptyline, Azathioprine, Captopril, Carbamazepine, Clindamycin, Cyproheptadine, Enalapril, Flutemide, Nitrofurantoin, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Sulfonamides, Trazodone, Verapamil Cholestatic pattern: Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, Anabolic steroids, Chlorpromazine, Clopidogrel, Oral contraceptives, Erythromycins, Estrogens, Irbesartan, Mirtazapine, Phenothiazines, Terbinafine, Tricyclics Hepatocellular Injury: R factor > 5 (Primary elevation of AST/ALT) Etiology Description Work Up Overdose/Toxins$ Acetaminophen, ASA, alcohol, cocaine, mushrooms (Amanita phalloides) Acetaminophen, ethanol level, Peth, UDS Acute Viral Hepatitis Hep A$, B $, C , D, E; EBV, CMV, HSV, VZV Viral serologies and PCR Autoimmune hepatitis* Presence of circulating autoantibodies and a high serum globulin concentration Anti-smooth muscle (f-actin), ANA, ANCA, anti-liver kidney microsome (anti-LKM-1), anti-soluble liver antigen/liver-pancreas IgG Budd-Chiari Syndrome* Hepatic vein obstruction Ultrasound of abdomen w/ doppler, CT w/ contrast DILI \u2013 Drug Induced Liver Injury*$ Dose independent (NOT an overdose) Review patient's med list with NIH Liver Tox Database: https://www.livertox.nih.gov HELLP Syndrome, Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy HELLP: A severe form of preeclampsia; AFLP: defects in fatty acid metabolism during pregnancy Check bHCG in females of reproductive age Ischemic Liver Injury (Shock Liver)$ Shock (can be of any variety) AST > ALT can be in the thousands, high LDH, history of hypotension, UDS to eval for vasoconstrictive drugs Wilson's Disease* Mutation in ATP7B, gene for copper transport protein, leads to accumulation of copper in liver and other organs Ceruloplasmin level (screening), 24h urine copper (confirmation), quantitative copper on liver biopsy.

Imaging: RUQ U/S with doppler (important to assess vasculature!) Consider CT with contrast in patients with normal renal function and high suspicion of Budd-Chiari syndrome or malignancy with negative ultrasound (better for assessing the hepatic veins) and helps with transplant evaluation Consider TTE to assess for cardiac dysfunction and aid in transplantation consideration Consider CTH or MRI to assess for cerebral edema (findings include decrease in ventricular size, flattening of cerebral convolutions, reduction in signal intensity of brain parenchyma) Consider ERCP/MRCP for cholestatic etiologies Discuss possible liver biopsy if etiology unclear Transjugular approach preferred with clinically demonstrable ascites; a known or suspected hemostatic defect; a small, hard, cirrhotic liver; morbid obesity with a difficult-to-identify flank site; or those in whom free and wedged hepatic vein pressure measurements are additionally being sought. Management Any pt with concern for ALF should be cared for in MICU (even if mild change in mental status) Pts with ALF may die acutely from hypoglycemia, cerebral edema, and infection ABC's: Intubate for GCS <8, Grade 3 or 4 HE IVF resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid (most pts are volume deplete; avoid hypotonic fluids due to risk of cerebral edema) Vasopressive agents for persistent hypotension (norepinephrine is the preferred agent, addition of vasopressin and stress dose steroids may be warranted) Monitoring: Q1-2h neuro checks, Q1-2h glucose checks Closely monitor CMP, Magnesium, phosphorus, INR q6-8 hrs Treatment of Primary Injury Early hepatology consult for liver transplant evaluation and assistance in management IV N-acetylcysteine: May improve transplant-free survival even in patients WITHOUT non-acetaminophen drug induced acute liver failure Initial loading dose = 150mg/kg over 1 hour, then 50mg/kg/hr for 4 hours, then 100mg/kg/hr for 16 hours Patients with early-stage hepatic encephalopathy (grade I/II) have increased transplant free survival, while those with grade III/IV do not Treatment of Secondary Complications Infection: Rule out infection with CXR, Blood cultures, UA/UCx for every ALF. Antibiotics only if progressing HE, signs of infection, or development of SIRS Cerebral edema/increased ICP: No role for lactulose in the setting of acute liver failure Grade III-IV hepatic encephalopathy: elevated HOB to 30 degrees, quiet and dimly lit room, should be intubated, avoid sedating medications as feasible, and ICP monitor are recommended (if not feasible, hourly neuro checks can be an alternative). If ICP becomes elevated start targeted therapies to reduce intracranial pressure.

Webber, DO LINES AND CATHETERS Author: Seth Alexander General Guidance Primary goals of line/catheter management: - Know why it was placed - Know where it is going (venous, arterial, potential space) - Know what needs to happen before it can be removed Risk of infection: All foreign objects run the risk of introducing microbes during placement or becoming a nidus for microbial growth. - Lines should only be placed when medically necessary and removed as medically appropriate. Note: This chapter does not include additional forms of invasive monitoring devices (i.e., Swan Ganz catheters), surgical/procedural drains, or support devices (i.e., endotracheal tubes, ventricular assist devices, etc.) as these typically require subspecialty consultation/management for consideration and are discussed elsewhere. Urinary Catheter Indications: - Surgery, immobilization, urinary retention, need for strict urine output monitoring (critical illness, diuresis), and open sacral/perineal wounds with incontinence - Chronic foleys should typically be exchanged on admission Potential complications: - Traumatic placement, difficult placement, and CAUTI - Any concern for catheter obstruction should prompt urgent urology consult - Determine if coud\u00e9 catheter placement attempted; can be useful in patients with BPH - Duration of use is the biggest risk factor for CAUTI; assess daily for need Criteria for removal: - Ability to void independently (with PVR follow-up) and resolution of placement indication Alternate devices: - Purewick catheter and condom catheter Central Venous Catheter Central venous access can be obtained through large central venous catheters (internal jugular, subclavian, or femoral CVC) or peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC). Indications: - Vasoactive infusions (pressors, inotropes), long-term antibiotics, inability to obtain peripheral access, caustic agent administration (chemotherapy, antibiotics, etc), and total parenteral nutrition - Note: single lumen PICC appropriate for most patients; double lumen typically reserved for special populations such as those in the ICU, on chemo, or on TPN Potential complications: - Arterial cannulation, air embolization, thrombus, or mispositioning during placement - Highest risk of insertion: femoral CVC - Pneumothorax: Subclavian CVC Criteria for removal: - Discontinuation of agents for which placement was indicated, transition to comfort care, or concern for central line associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) Alternative devices: - Peripheral venous access (consider US-guided) - There are indwelling catheters (tunneled ports, Hickman lines) which are more permanent central venous access devices used in patients with need for intermittent central venous access, typically placed by IR or surgery Arterial Lines Indications: - Accurate blood pressure measurement, frequent arterial blood draws (ABG) Potential complications: - Arterial occlusion (spasm, thrombus), with resultant ischemia, hematoma formation Criteria for removal: - Resolution of placement criteria Feeding Tubes Described in further detail below.

Update all components of the handover daily: Synopsis Include patient's name, age, pertinent medical history, and key hospital diagnoses/events. Example: \"John Doe is a 57-year-old man with a past medical history of HTN and HLD who presented with NSTEMI, now s/p LHC on 3/7, on DAPT.\" Include code status and, if applicable, capacity to leave AMA To-dos Provide specific instructions on the task to be performed and at what time. Example: \"21:00 \u2013 Follow-up intake/output. If urine output is less than 2L, order 160mg IV Lasix.\" Ensure the covering person has the resources to act. For example, if following-up a CBC for a pt with GI bleed, make sure the pt has a reliable form of access and has consented for blood. Contingencies Should include instructions for common overnight pages as well as patient-specific recommendations. At a minimum, contingencies should address: pain, fever, nausea, hypoxia, hemodynamic instability, tachycardia, and AMS. Write contingencies for patient-specific situations and what you would do differently for your patient than other patients on your list. I-PASS When giving verbal handoff for complicated patients, use the I-PASS technique: I: Illness severity (stable, watcher, unstable) P: Patient summary (one-liner with working/confirmed diagnosis, key elements of hospital course including major medication changes/procedures/interventions, and any pertinent physical exam findings or lab result (important particularly if a patient has known neuro exam findings, baseline severe hyponatremia, etc in the event they are called about this) A: Action list: formatted as to-do's, above S: Situation awareness: i.e., contingency planning S: Synthesis by receiver: summarize the pertinent diagnoses, action list, and clarify any questions HIGH QUALITY CONSULTS (How to Ask for Help Like a Pro) Author: Alice Kennedy Communicate a concise goal with a specific question/request: - Do you need help diagnosing a patient or thinking about the next step? - Are you looking for an expert to help co-manage a specific condition (for example tacro dosing for a transplant patient)? - Does your patient need a specific procedure? Know your patient, but share only the most pertinent information in your one liner: - Always see the patient and inform them about the consult prior to placing the order. - Practice a concise one liner to frame the situation over the phone. - Communicate the patient's degree of stability so that the consultant can assess the urgency of assessment. Ensure appropriate timing: - Please place consults in the morning if at all possible. - Consider pending consult orders to sign efficiently during rounds. - Most consultants for the day shift arrive at 7AM. If you need an after-hours consult, please prioritize as urgent/STAT as appropriate so that the consultant receives a notification of your request. - If requesting a procedure that requires sedation, consider making patient NPO/ holding DVT ppx or sedation. Anticipate basic information your consultant will need: Cardiology: an EKG should generally have been performed and you should have your own interpretation prepped. Do your best to assess the patient's volume status. What is their JVP? Are there crackles on exam? Is there pitting edema? Pulm/MICU: please call from the bedside about urgent problems. Infectious Disease: do your best to do initial history taking/detective work. There is a \"staph pager\" that goes off whenever anyone in the hospital has Staph aureus, Enterococcus or yeast grows from a blood culture and ID may ask to be consulted in these circumstances. TRANSITIONS OF CARE: DISCHARGE PLANNING Author: Christine Hamilton Discharge from hospital represents a period of vulnerability for patients. Medical errors (especially medication errors) following discharge are exceedingly common. On Admission: Verify PCP, primary specialty providers, social support, current living situation, and functional status on arrival. Careful med rec , track any new meds, held/stopped meds, and med dose changes from the beginning Review all meds with patient/family Make sure to discuss any OTC medications and herbals as they can have significant interactions Check recent notes/transfer documents for any recent changes. Use dispense history in Epic to assess adherence or if information is limited. Consult PT/OT early for anyone who you anticipate may need home health services or need to be discharged to any location besides home During Hospitalization: During team rounds: consider barriers to discharge daily In huddle, discuss anticipated discharge timing, destination, and any other needs With patients and families: discuss discharge timing to set expectations Track any incidental findings or things for PCP to follow-up (e.g., incidental nodules on scans: use .vnincidental) within the \"hospital course\" On Discharge Day: Communicate with patient's outpatient team (e.g. PCP): - Typically achieved through the discharge summary - Include a list of specific, actionable follow-up tasks and assign a responsible party. Place in easy-to-view spot at the top of the summary - Example: Instead of writing \"follow-up BMP after initiation of furosemide,\" write \"PCP to check BMP in 2 weeks after initiation of furosemide\" - Include any pending studies and appointments from hospital admission - All relevant parties should receive a copy of the discharge summary (see appendices section for mechanics of discharge process) - It is useful to send patient with a printed copy of the discharge summary if they will follow-up outside VUMC - Route a copy of your DC summary to a specific party using the routing function under the Epic discharge tab - For high-risk discharges (poor health literacy, hx of being lost to follow-up, follow up outside VUMC), consider calling PCP's office to set follow-up Complete an accurate and thorough medication reconciliation: - An accurate discharge medication list depends on having a complete admission medication reconciliation (utilize Pharmacy Consult!) - Steps: - Identify any medication changes, including to route, dose, or frequency. - Check the MAR to be sure patient has been accepting offered medications while in hospital. - Assess medications and dosages are appropriate. - Review with the team and pharmacist if possible the day before discharge! - Use this as an opportunity to deprescribe to reduce pill burden and potential harms - Clearly document any medication changes in patient discharge instructions and the discharge summary. - Can include follow up tasks if pertinent (ex: PCP to follow-up BP in 2 weeks. Losartan held on d/c due to AKI but anticipate need to reinitiate once CR normalizes) - Review all important medication changes with the patient and/or caregiver. Ensure that appropriate resources and follow-up appointments have been requested: - PT/OT, skilled or non-skilled nursing HH, PCP follow-up, etc. Effectively communicate discharge plan to patient: - Discuss medication changes, tasks for patient to complete, follow-up appointments - Key points should also be written in the patient instructions box - Useful to include educational sheets in the AVS (searchable in discharge navigator) - Utilize teach-back method to ensure your instructions were effectively communicated Discharge Care Center at VUMC Multidisciplinary team including nurses, social workers, care coordinators, and pharmacists Phone number is included on discharge paperwork, and patients can contact them 24/7. The DCC also reaches out to patients through an automated system PATIENT-DIRECTED DISCHARGES (PDD, Formerly Known as AMA) Author: Christine Hamilton PDDs have a higher risk of hospital readmission and result in higher mortality rates. If paged from the bedside about a patient requesting to leave \"AMA,\" call nurse back and then go speak with the patient. Steps: Address patient concerns (i.e. pain control, substance withdrawal, fear/anxiety, financial strain, diet) to mitigate reversible causes for contention. Determine capacity to leave: review risks of leaving and medical reasoning to stay (see Medical Decision-Making Capacity under \"Psychiatry\"). This discussion should be witnessed by nurse or charge nurse if possible. Provider and patient will need to sign AMA discharge form, which nurse can obtain. Send new medications to pharmacy and request hospital follow-up visits if patient leaves Sign discharge order. In the \"discharge to\" section select \"left against medical advice\" (for more detailed discharge instructions, see appendices) Clearly document in discharge summary that patient was informed about the risks of leaving, had the capacity to make the decision to leave, and left prematurely based on your clinical judgement. Caveat: if patient at any point becomes threatening or you feel unsafe, allow them to leave or contact security WOUNDS Adapted from Dr. Duggan's Geriatrics Guide To Do When Admitting a Patient with Wounds Document ALL wounds that are present on admission.

The Custodial Agency is responsible for the safety of the patient: - Correctional Officers are responsible for safe application and maintenance of restraints (i.e. handcuffs/ shackles). Concerns about appropriate restraints can first be addressed directly to the officers and if not resolved, VUPD - VUPD does not assume custody when patients are admitted. Custodial patients are not allowed visitation as per VUMC policy: - Specific requests may be made and approved by VUPD and the Custodial Agency (i.e. prison/jail). Documentation pearls: - A flag will appear in epic to notify clinicians that the patient is under custody. - Notes should only include information pertaining to the patient's clinical care (for example: duration of incarceration may be relevant but specific charges are likely not). Safety concerns should be addressed immediately with VUPD (call 911 or (615) 421-1911). Resources: - The AC, ethics, and legal can all be valuable resources. - Specific VUMC Policy: https://vanderbilt.policytech.com/dotNet/documents/?app=pt&source=unspecified&docid=39805 - Another valuable resource: https://www.scopesandshields.org/ ENTERAL NUTRITION Author: Christine Hamilton Indications for Enteral Feeding High nutrition risk with inability to tolerate PO intake Patients whose intake does not support their metabolic demands. Guidelines recommend calculating nutritional risk based on validated scoring tool (e.g. Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool). This is usually completed by the nutrition team. Who would benefit from nutrition consult to assist with risk determination? Patients with >5% weight loss in past 1-3 months or decreased oral intake coupled with increased metabolic demands (i.e. medical illness or surgery) Critically ill patients: goal is early initiation of tube feeding (within 48 hours) Contraindications to Enteral Nutrition Patients at low nutritional risk (you anticipate improved intake within 5-7 days) Bowel obstruction or severe ileus Ischemic bowel Acute peritonitis Major gastrointestinal bleeding Intractable vomiting Significant hemodynamic instability Patients who are not adequately volume resuscitated and have significant hemodynamic instability (e.g. high pressor requirements) are at increased risk for bowel ischemia. Pressors in general are not a contraindication to tube feeds. Okay to start once pressors are down-trending or at a stable level. Obtaining Enteral Access Typically place nasogastric or orogastric feeding tube in acute setting. See \"Procedures\" section for tips on placement. For most patients, enteral feeding is safe with gastric tube placement. Consider post-pyloric placement for patients with high aspiration risk, impaired gastric motility, or patients who have demonstrated intolerance with gastric feeding. Consider percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement if anticipate enteral nutrition >4 weeks Choice of Formula and Rate: Place Nutrition Consult Okay to start tube feeds prior to recommendations and adjust later, especially if recommendations will be delayed. 25-30 cal/kg (use ideal body weight for most patients, use actual weight for underweight patient) to estimate daily needs. Most common formulas at VUMC: Nutren 1.5 (1.5 cal/ml), Novasource renal (2 cal/ml) Patients may need additional free water (most tube feed formulas are comprised of 80-85% water but varies with type). Typically dose as bolus of free water every 4-6 hours. May empirically try 250cc free water q4h and monitor Na trends. May need more if already with a large fluid deficit (e.g. hypernatremia) or if high volume losses. Calculate hourly rate based on daily calorie need and formula calorie density: - Example: Patient with IBW of 70Kg will need estimated 1,750 calories per day (70 x 25 cal/kg). If using Nutren 1.5, this will equal 1,167 ml per day (1,750 divided by 1.5 calories per ml). This would equal a goal rate of about 50ml per hour (rounded up) of Nutren 1.5 - Resources for quick calculations: - Search for \"tube feed cheat sheet\" on google and will find reference tables on EMCrit.org that gives you rate per hour for different weights and formula types - Clincalc.com also has a useful enteral nutrition calculator Start initially at a low rate (such as 10 mL/hr) to assess tolerability and advance to goal: - If no concern for refeeding syndrome, typically increase by 10cc/hr q6h - If risk for refeeding syndrome or other issues with tolerability, typically advance more slowly over several days Condensing to Bolus Feeds Typically begin condensing by providing 4 bolus meals per day run over 2 hours, then shorten run time to ~30 minutes or by gravity NOTE: J-tube cannot be bolused; if condensing feeds for patients receiving enteral nutrition via J-tube, typically you can increase the rate to run all nutrition over 10-14 hours to allow the patient freedom from the pump Potential Complications Aspiration: - Recommendation to keep head of bed elevated at 30 to 45 degrees (low quality, mixed evidence). Consider risks of this positioning (e.g. formation of pressure ulcers) - Consider post-pyloric placement if issues with aspiration (low quality, mixed evidence) Diarrhea or constipation: - Consider wheat dextrin fiber supplement (low quality evidence) but discontinue if not associated with clinical improvement. Avoid less soluble fibers such as psyllium due to risk of clogging tube. Avoid in patients with reduced GI motility due to rare risk of bezoar formation. Hyperglycemia: - See Endocrine section for management Refeeding syndrome: - Monitor q8 hour Mg, phos, K in high-risk patients (underweight, recent weight loss, prolonged poor intake) and advance to goal slowly GUIDELINES FOR PREGNANT PATIENTS Author: Christine Hamilton Bacteriuria Acute cystitis: - Treatment: empiric with cephalexin, cefpodoxime, amoxicillin-clavulanate, Fosfomycin. Nitrofurantoin and Bactrim typically avoided in first trimester and near term but safe to try if no appropriate alternatives. Tailor based on culture results. Treat for 5-7 days. - If UA negative but patient with symptoms of dysuria, obtain STI testing Pyelonephritis: - Higher incidence in pregnancy compared to non-pregnant women, most often in second/third trimesters - Risk factors: Age <20y, nulliparity, smoking, late presentation to care, sickle cell trait, and pre-existing (not gestational) diabetes - Associated with preterm birth - Diagnosis: fever, flank pain, nausea/vomiting, and/or dysuria with bacteriuria. Rule out intraamniotic infection, placental abruption - Management: Patients typically require admission. Obtain blood cultures and initiate IV antibiotics for 1st 24-48hrs; beta-lactams (CTX or Zosyn) preferred. Avoid fluoroquinolones. - De-escalation: Once afebrile for 48 hours, switch to PO beta-lactam (preferred) for total 7-10 days. Asymptomatic bacteriuria: - Occurs in 2-7% of pregnant women, most often in first trimester - Without treatment, ~25% of pregnant women will develop symptomatic UTI - Complications of untreated bacteriuria associated with preterm birth, low birth weight, and perinatal mortality in some studies - Diagnosis: pyuria and >100,000 cfu/mL bacteria Refractory Nausea/Vomiting Presentation: hormone mediated nausea/vomiting typically starting before 9wks GA Differential: gastroenteritis, hepatitis, biliary tract disease, obstruction, pancreatitis, pyelonephritis, nephrolithiasis, ovarian torsion, DKA, hyperparathyroidism, migraines, preeclampsia Workup: BMP, mg, phos, LFTs, lipase (may be mildly elevated in HG), UA Treatment: 1st line: ginger, doxylamine (25mg PO q6h), pyridoxine (20mg PO q6h) 2nd line: diphenhydramine (25-50mg q6h), metoclopramide (10mg q6h), promethazine (12.5mg q6h), or compazine (5-10mg q6h) 3rd Line: ondansetron (8mg q12h, after 1st trimester) Hydration: 1L LR on admission + banana bag q24hrs Hypertension Both gestational HTN and preeclampsia/HELLP are typically diagnosed >20w GA Tx options: nifedipine, labetalol, methyldopa, hydral (2nd line), clonidine (2nd line) Avoid: ACEi, ARB, MRA, nitroprusside Diabetes Due to hormonal changes associated with pregnancy, pregnant patients are at higher risk for poor control and DKA. Poorly controlled diabetes is also associated with congenital anomalies of the fetus and early pregnancy loss. Medication: Metformin and Insulin preferred. GLP-1 agonists, SGLT-2 inhibitors, and DPP-4 inhibitors should be discontinued. Consider starting ASA 81mg to reduce risk for preeclampsia GERD 1st line: lifestyle and dietary medication 2nd line: antacids or sucralfate 1g PO TID. Avoid sodium bicarbonate and magnesium 3rd line: Histamine 2 receptor antagonists such as cimetidine 200mg (30min prior to eating) 4th line: PPI such as omeprazole or pantoprazole Asthma Similar rescue and controller medications as in non-pregnant patient Would favor using LABA > leukotriene receptor antagonists for additional therapy Obtaining Imaging A missed or delayed diagnosis can pose a greater risk to patients and their pregnancy than the hazard associated with ionizing radiation Discuss with radiologist when ordering; often adjustments can be made in pregnancy that maintain imaging integrity and utility In general, should limit fetal ionizing radiation exposure to <50 mGy (for reference, a two-view CXR is ~0.01mGy, a KUB is ~2 mGy, and a pelvic CT is anywhere from 10-50 mGy). Iodinated contrast is not contraindicated but can cross the placenta and depress fetal thyroid. MRI is safe in pregnancy and in some cases preferred, particularly in the first trimester however gadolinium contrast should generally be avoided unless absolutely necessary.

ALL wounds are colonized with microorganisms and superficial wound cultures should not be collected nor used to make treatment decisions. Do NOT administer antibiotics to clinically stable patients until deep tissue or operative cultures are obtained. Failure of oral antibiotics used for < 48 hours is NOT a reason to use broad-spectrum antibiotics. Evaluation Plain radiograph for all pts; MRI w/contrast if abscess/osteo suspected Use of inflammatory markers such as ESR or CRP at baseline may help determine level of inflammation with periodic trending (e.g. weekly) thereafter. Do NOT repeat these tests daily. BCx (prior to antibiotics) if systemic signs of infection, or severe infection Do not culture superficial swabs of lesions, as these generally only grow colonizing organisms. Consider obtaining MRSA nasal PCR. (ensure collected before nasal decolonization); ~90% negative predictive values for diabetic foot infections Consult podiatry if osteomyelitis present for bone specimen culture and pathology (either from debridement specimen or bone biopsy) prior to starting antibiotics.

Would discuss with ID if complex Endocarditis Author: Justin Smith Background Multiple etiologies of endocarditis: Typical Bacterial S. aureus, Enterococcus spp (E. faecalis most commonly), viridans group streptococci, Strep gallolyticus (formerly S. bovis) HACEK: Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, Kingella Other infectious Culture negative: often recent antimicrobial exposure, slow growing organism Coxiella, Brucella, Bartonella, Chlamydia, Legionella, Mycoplasma, Tropheryma whipplei, Cutibacterium acnes (formerly P. acnes) Fungal: Candida and aspergillus most common Non-infectious: a.k.a., marantic endocarditis, Libman-Sacks Endocarditis Rare, most common in advanced malignancy, SLE, inflammatory conditions Higher risk for embolization compared to IE Risk factors: IV drug use, congenital heart disease, valve abnormalities, intracardiac devices, recent cardiac surgery Presentation Fever (90%), murmur (85%), other: splenomegaly, splinter hemorrhages, Janeway lesions, Osler nodes, Roth spots Persistent bacteremia despite appropriate treatment, new onset cardiac dysfunction, new onset valve abnormalities, stroke, other thromboembolic events, metastatic infections/abscesses, splenic abscess, septic pulmonary emboli Duke Criteria: Pathologic Criteria Microorganisms: culture or histology proven: vegetation, embolus, or intracardiac abscess Pathologic vegetations: vegetation of abscess with histology proven endocarditis Clinical Criteria Definite: 2 Major, 1 major and 3 minor, or 5 minor Possible: 1 major and 1 minor, or 3 minor Rejected: firm alternate diagnosis, resolution of evidence with <4 days of antibiotics, or absence of pathologic evidence with <4days of antibiotics Major Criteria Minor Criteria 2x positive blood cultures from a typical organism Predisposing heart condition/IDU Evidence of endocardial involvement Fever Vascular phenomena (glomerulonephritis) Immunologic phenomena (Osler nodes, Roth spots, +rheumatoid factor, GN) Micro (cultures that don't fit the above, or serologic evidence of acute infection) Evaluation Physical exam: murmur, decreased peripheral perfusion, evidence of heart failure, petechiae, splinter hemorrhages, Janeway lesions/Osler nodes, organomegaly Blood cultures: at least three sets from different sites over a span of several hours Echo (TTE vs TEE) It can be reasonable to start with TEE if pretest probability is high enough, if pt already has known valvular abnormalities, or TTE will be technically difficult EKG: new heart block or prolonged PR raises concern for endocardial/perivalvular abscess. Endocarditis pts should be on telemetry, monitored closely by team. CXR: infiltrates suggestive of septic pulmonary emboli, pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly Imaging of distant affected site if concerned for septic emboli Other advanced imaging in select scenario: cardiac CTA, cardiac MRI, FDG-PET/CT Management Empiric antibiotics: If bacteria isolated from blood, reference bacteremia section for abx choice If awaiting cultures Native valve: Vancomycin +/- GNR coverage (depending on clinical stability, risk factors, etc) Prosthetic valve: Vancomycin and cefepime, consider gentamicin Antibiotic Duration: determined by ID, often 4-6 weeks Cardiac surgery consult: if valve dysfunction, perivalvular abscess, large (>20mm) vegetations, heart block, ongoing embolization on abx, delayed Cx clearance (>1 week on abx) Additional Information: Complications: Cardiac: Heart failure: usually secondary to valve dysfunction. Most common when aortic valve involved, risk also depends on organism (worst is Staph aureus) Perivalvular abscess: suspect when there are conduction abnormalities on EKG. Pericarditis: can be suppurative or non-suppurative Intracardiac Fistula Septic emboli and metastatic abscesses Mycotic aneurysm: usually occurs at vessel branch points Follow Up Repeat TTE at completion of treatment to establish new baseline Followed for valvular dysfunction with frequency determined by nature of the dysfunction Regular dental care; prior IE is an indication for SBE prophylaxis with dental work. Episode of IE is an indication for PDA or VSD closure Fever in a Return Traveler Author: Michael Daw Background Treatment of fever in a return traveler will depend on where the traveler came from and what risk their fever poses to themselves or others. ALWAYS remember to think about common US illnesses that are frequently transmitted due to exposure to crowds in airports, airplanes, bus stations, etc (mononucleosis (EBV and CMV), influenza, other common cold viruses, etc.) Presentation Is the pt sick? AMS, tachypneic, hypotensive Do they have signs of severe disease? Cyanosis, meningism (nuchal rigidity, photophobia, headache), peritonitis, digital gangrene History Pearls Obtain travel history: location(s), activities, purpose of travel, accommodations Did they visit a friend or relative? (less likely to seek pretravel medical advice, higher risk for malaria, typhoid fever, tuberculosis, hepatitis A, and STD) Consumption of unclean water or risky foods, insect/tick bites, animal exposures, sexual contact Were they hospitalized abroad? (consider MDR organisms) Evaluate immunization status and chemoprophylaxis received before/during travel. Check out the CDC Yellow Book: https://www.cdc.gov/yellow-book/index.html Etiologies based on clinical syndrome: Clinical Syndrome Possible Etiologies Skin rash with or without conjunctivitis and fever measles, typhus, dengue, chikungunya (both dengue and chikungunya tend to also cause severe muscle and joint aches), Zika, meningococcemia, hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola Rapid respiratory rate influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS], pneumonic plague, histoplasmosis Persistent cough TB, pertussis, fungal infections like coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, cryptococcus Decreased consciousness malaria, meningococcal meningitis, rabies, tickborne encephalitis Bruising or unusual bleeding without previous injury hemorrhagic fevers Persistent voluminous diarrhea campylobacter, shigella, salmonella \u2013 although many do not usually present with fever - Traveler's diarrhea, cholera, giardiasis Persistent vomiting other than air or motion sickness norovirus Jaundice hepatitis A, B (if not vaccinated), D, E; leptospirosis Flaccid paralysis of recent onset polio Genital lesions HIV, G/C, hepatitis, syphilis, Mpox, hemorrhagic fevers, lymphogranuloma venereum If no localizing symptoms, consider usual incubation periods: <21 days: East African trypanosomiasis, dengue, Zika, chikungunya, Japanese encephalitis, leptospirosis, malaria, meningococcemia, nontyphoidal salmonellosis, plague, typhoid fever, typhus, viral hemorrhagic fevers, yellow fever >21 days: acute HIV, acute systemic schistosomiasis, amebic liver abscess, borreliosis (relapsing fever), brucellosis, leishmaniasis, malaria (esp after ineffective prophylaxis), rabies, TB, viral hepatitides, West African trypanosomiasis Relapsing fevers (fever spikes separated by days or weeks): borreliosis, malaria 48 hour interval fevers: plasmodium vivax or P ovale 72 hour fevers: Plasmodium malariae intermittent, unsynchronized: P falciparum Domestic travelers (within the US), consider: tickborne illness (ehrlichia, anaplasmosis, STARI, Lyme, Rocky Mtn Spotted fever), coccidiomycosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, cryptococcus, tularemia, hantavirus Evaluation: Most common serious cause of fever from travel to certain areas is malaria falciparum : order thick and thin blood smears and note that the order is for malaria blood smear (if you order thick and thin w/o malaria order, it will not be done in an urgent manner). If negative, order repeat smears over 24-72 hrs. Viral hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola, Crimean\u2013Congo hemorrhagic fever, Marburg hemorrhagic fever, and Lassa fever are highly transmissible and require immediate treatment. IF suspicious, VUMC Infection prevention should be notified IMMEDIATELY. Special precautions and protocols should be initiated to protect treating team. Initial labs: CBC w/diff, CMP, blood cx, rapid tests for malaria and dengue, PCR testing of plasma sample (for tick borne), CXR, blood smear (thick and thin), UA with microscopy and culture. Consider O&P, head imaging or LP, or additional abdominal imaging in the right clinical context. Don't forget the common causes of fever (could have nothing to do with pt's travel or could be routine infections seen in US) Empiric doxycycline is a reasonable adjunct for undifferentiated non-malaria fevers Look up current outbreaks to help guide clinical suspicion. https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news Fungal Infections Author: Ally Glover Evaluation Bacterial BCx can detect candidemia but low sensitivity (50%). Fungal blood cultures also with low sensitivity. Beta-d-glucan: note will not be elevated in mucormycosis, cryptococcosis, and blastomycosis. Aspergillus galactomannan: BAL > serum. Pts with risk factors for candidemia (TPN, chronic line, GI disease, persistent neutropenic fever) with concerning clinical syndrome can be treated empirically with micafungin. Candida Infections Background Part of normal flora of human GI and GU tract Broad range of associated diseases from vaginal candidiasis to candidemia Pts at highest risk of severe / invasive candida infection (candidemia): Burn / surgical ICU pts Solid organ recipients Chemo pts / malignant heme pts TPN dependent / central access pts (especially in ICU) Presentation Oropharyngeal: white plaques/patches in mouth +/- erythema, painful when eating Esophageal: dysphagia/odynophagia, chest pain w/ swallowing Vulvovaginitis: white, thick discharge; pruritus/erythema Balanitis: white patches on penis with severe burning/itching Mastitis: breast feeding pts with nipple injury Invasive focal infections UTI: ascending infection (can often be unilateral) vs. hematologic source (micro abscesses) Peritonitis: often in peritoneal dialysis pts Mediastinitis: often post thoracic surgery Hepatosplenic: often in pts who just recovered from neutropenia in setting of heme malignancy Candidemia: sepsis, often in setting of critical illness, think about when above risk factors present Evaluation Blood: candida is NEVER a contaminant in blood cultures Urine: culture is standard method of identification but RARELY a urinary pathogen Management Candidemia / critical illness: start micafungin 100mg daily, consult ID Vulvovaginitis: fluconazole 150mg x1 if mild, 150mg every 72 hrs for 2-3 doses if severe Oropharyngeal: nystatin oral suspension if mild thrush, if moderate \u2013 severe candidiasis then fluconazole 100-200mg qday for 7-14 days Esophageal candidiasis (AIDS defining illness): fluconazole 200-400mg qday or micafungin 150mg daily for 14-21 days as an alternative agent Additional information Remember to check susceptibilities (C krusei has intrinsic azole resistance and C glabrata has high rates of fluconazole resistance) Aspergillosis Background Most often in pts who have prolonged neutropenia, high dose steroids, or other immunosuppressive drug regimen or condition Take thorough hx: farming, occupational exposure where pt might have inhaled conidia Presentation Classic pulmonary aspergillosis presentation: neutropenic pt with fever, pleuritic chest pain and hemoptysis Tracheobronchitis: can occur in lung transplant pts Evaluation Aspergillus galactomannan Ag Lung imaging if concerned for pulmonary aspergillosis Differentiate possible vs probable vs proven (tissue) aspergillosis as it can reflect colonization without proper clinical syndrome or host Management Consult ID. Usually treat with voriconazole or other triazole (posaconazole, isavuconazole). Preferred over amphotericin based on clinical trials. Fluconazole is NOT active against aspergillus Blastomycosis Background Endemic in midwest, southeast, southern central US, and parts of Canada that border the Great Lakes Mostly pulmonary manifestations, 25-40% of infections w/ extrapulmonary involvement (skin, bone, GU, and CNS presentations) Presentation Pulmonary symptoms common: dyspnea, cough, fever, hemoptysis, chest pain Verrucous lesions with irregular borders Osteolytic bone lesions Draining sinuses Evaluation: Serum and urine blastomycosis Ag Antibody testing less useful in acute disease (interpret with caution) Management Pulmonary blastomycosis Mild to Moderate: itraconazole 6-12 months Moderate to Severe: ampho followed by itraconazole for 6-12 months Disseminated extrapulmonary blastomycosis: ampho followed by itraconazole for a year Note: in anyone who is immunosuppressed, especially pts with AIDS, start with amphotericin CNS blastomycosis: 4-6 weeks of ampho followed by a year of itraconazole Histoplasmosis Background The most common endemic mycosis in the US. Endemic to Ohio and Mississippi river valley. Most infections are not clinically significant / do not require treatment. At risk for disseminated disease (HIV, transplant recipients, immunocompromised, TNF-alpha inhibitors, elderly) Differential diagnosis: TB, malignancy, sarcoidosis, other fungal infection Presentation Pulmonary histo: pna w/ mediastinal or hilar LND or masses, pulmonary nodules, cavitation Disseminated histo: fever, mediastinal LND, diffuse pulm interstitial infiltrates, HSM, liver involvement, popular rash, cytopenias, mucosal lesions, \u2191 LDH, ferritin, adrenal involvement, colonic involvement. Evaluation Send BOTH Urine and Serum antigens. Requires attending name to order. Antibody testing less useful in acute disease (interpret with caution) Other diagnostics to consider: peripheral smear/buffy coat, fungal blood cultures, LDH, ferritin, BAL with cultures and cytology Remember histo Ag has high cross reactivity with blasto Ag Management: Amphotericin and Itraconazole- discuss with ID, pharmacy about dosing, duration. Pulmonary histo: Mediastinal granuloma, fibrosis, broncholithiasis: usually no tx. Mild-moderate acute pulmonary histo: itraconazole if persistent symptoms > 1mo Chronic cavitations: itraconazole, likely 1 to 2 years Severe acute pulmonary histo: amphotericin for 1-2 weeks +/- methylprednisolone followed by itraconazole for 12 weeks Disseminated histo: Mild-moderate disseminated disease: itraconazole for ~12 months Severe disseminated disease: ampho for 1-2 weeks followed by itraconazole for ~12 mo Additional information Disseminated histoplasmosis can be associated with secondary HLH. Follow CBC closely. If concerned for sarcoidosis, need to rule out histo prior to starting treatment for sarcoidosis Urine antigen can be used to trend response to treatment Genitourinary Infection Author: VASP Asymptomatic Bacteriuria Background Isolation of bacteria in an appropriately collected urine specimen from an individual without symptoms or signs of urinary tract infection. Bacteriuria, foul odor, urine appearance, pyuria, falls and/or confusion alone are not indicative of infection. Oliguric ESRD pts may have bacteriuria from colonization due to lack of flushing of bladder; avoid sending UA/UCx unless pt is symptomatic Treatment only required for specific populations: Pregnant women (screening performed at 12 \u2013 16 weeks) Anticipated urologic intervention - when requesting, be sure to ask for Micro help in identifying potential pathogens needing treatment vs. likely contaminants Some renal transplant recipients, depending on time since transplant Complicated UTI and Pyelonephritis See UTI algorithm (https://www.vumc.org/antimicrobial-stewardship-program/guidelines) on VASP website Background Fever, pyuria, and costovertebral angle tenderness suggest pyelonephritis. Consider it a complicated UTI if any of the following are present: Renal calculi or other obstructive disease, immunosuppressed host, abnormal urological anatomy or physiology (including stents), presence of a urinary catheter Male sex alone does NOT qualify as complicated Sepsis or bacteremia Evaluation UA with reflex urine culture ONLY in patients with symptoms If unable to obtain history, evaluate for objective signs of infection (fever, hypotension, tachycardia, leukocytosis, etc.) and evaluate for alternative explanations (O2 requirement suggest pneumonia, post-op fever within 48 hours, etc.) BCx and UCx prior to abx If there is no pyuria, consider an alternative diagnosis, or proximal ureteral obstruction Pyuria is common in the presence of a urinary catheter, kidney stones, urostomy, ileal conduit and other invasive devices, and may not indicate infection Management Antibiotic Duration: 7-14 days, depending on antibiotic choice Tailor therapy once/if cultures are available. If no improvement in 48h, consider imaging to rule out complications (e.g., perinephric abscess) Transition from IV to PO should be considered for patients who meet the following criteria: able to tolerate enteral medications, signs of clinical improvement (defervesced, afebrile, down-trending WBC, etc.) Days of IV therapy count towards overall treatment duration. First Line Alternative Outpt Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 875-125mg BID x14 days Ciprofloxacin 500mg BID or levofloxacin 750 mg daily x 7 days TMP/SMX 1-2 DS BID x 7 days Inpt Ceftriaxone 2g q24h Cefepime 2g q8h Pip/tazo 3.375g q8h ext infusion Meropenem 1g q8h (if h/o or confirmed ESBL within the last 90 days) Ertapenem 1g q24 instead of Meropenem if no Pseudomonas Ciprofloxacin 750mg PO BID (500 mg PO BID if bacteremia ruled out) OR 400mg IV BID (if susceptibility confirmed) FQ's have same bioavailability if given PO or IV so oral is preferred Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) Background Clinical symptoms of UTI (dysuria/urgency/frequency/ hematuria) in non-pregnant, immunocompetent, neurologically intact pt with normal urologic anatomy and no indwelling urinary catheters Management Empiric therapy Nitrofurantoin monohydrate: 100 mg PO BID x 5 days (avoid if any concern for pyelonephritis or if creatinine clearance <30) Cephalexin 250-500mg q6h x5-7 days Alternative therapies Fosfomycin: 3 grams of powder mixed in water as a single PO dose (avoid if any concern for ascending UTI or pyelonephritis). Susceptibility test results must be requested, only possible for E. coli and E. Faecalis. Amoxicillin-clavulanate: 875-125mg PO BID x5-7 days Ciprofloxacin: 250mg PO BID x3 days FQ's should be reserved for more serious infections than uncomplicated cystitis, and only after susceptibility results are confirmed given high rates of resistance Adverse effect profile >> beta-lactams (i.e. QT-prolongation, tendinopathies) Avoid amoxicillin, ampicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) due to increasing resistance unless culture data with confirmed susceptibility Additional Information MDR cystitis: ESBL isolates are increasingly common due to antibiotic overuse Before treating, decide if this is a TRUE UTI If true, consider Fosfomycin (if E. coli) or nitrofurantoin (if susceptibility is confirmed \u2013 K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter spp are usually resistant), gentamicin or tobramycin 5 mg/kg IV once (even in setting of AKI), or ID consultation Ask the lab to check susceptibility results to these antibiotics for future reference Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI) Background Culture growth of > 10\u00b3 cfu/mL of uropathogenic bacteria + signs or symptoms consistent with infection (without another identified etiology) + indwelling urethral/suprapubic catheter or intermittent catheterization. This includes pts with catheters in place during the preceding 48 hours Duration = greatest risk factor (increases 3-10% per day of catheterization) Other risks: female sex, diabetes, elderly, colonization of catheter bag, poor care Bacteriuria, foul odor, pyuria, urine appearance falls and/or confusion alone are not indicative of infection in pts who are otherwise asymptomatic. Ensure clean sample collected Ideally, catheter is removed and midstream sample obtained If catheterization required; removal of old catheter and sample taken from new catheter Management Distinguish uncomplicated vs complicated UTI (see above) Antimicrobial management: Guided by cultures and susceptibilities Duration: 7 \u2013 14 days depending on abx, clinical response and whether infection constitutes complicated vs uncomplicated UTI Special note regarding Candida UTI management: Candida is generally not pathogenic Presence in urine does not indicate infection (unless perinephric abscess, renal transplant, or complex fistulous disease) Fluconazole achieves excellent urinary penetration while micafungin does not If fluconazole-resistant Candida is cultured or suspected, consult ID Susceptibilities are not routinely run-on Candida from urine cultures and would need to be requested if concern for true infection. Catheter management At the least, catheters should be replaced at the time of antibiotic initiation (preferably removed). If catheterization is necessary, intermittent catheterization is preferred over continuous use with pt educations on cleaning/hygiene prior to catheterization. Condom catheters and pure wicks also preferred over foley catheter. GI Infections Authors: Lin Cao, Ahmed Samy Acute Diarrhea Presentation \u22653 BMs/day or abnormally loose stools Vast majority of infectious diarrhea cases are acute with more persistent diarrhea, consider additional workup for noninfectious etiologies as well Can be watery or inflammatory (bloody stools, signs of sepsis, severe abdominal pain) History: food hx (particularly undercooked meats or unpasteurized dairy), occupational exposures, recent travel, pet and animal exposures, immunocompromised Evaluation Exam: volume status, abdominal pain Labs: CBC for leukocytosis/eosinophilia, BMP for electrolyte abnormalities, BCx if c/f systemic illness, consider GIPP or stool testing if severe illness or immunocompromise Management Most cases are self-limited and resolve with just supportive care Antimotility agents: bismuth subsalicylate, loperamide Avoid antimotility agents with C. diff and inflammatory diarrhea Avoid abx with Shigella and EHEC (can precipitate HUS), Salmonella (prolongs carrier time) Antibiotics only indicated with severe illness or certain immunocompromised hosts: Cipro 500mg bid Levofloxacin 500mg qd 3-5 days Azithro 500mg qd 3 days C. Diff (see GI section) Other GI Infections: Less commonly infectious than acute diarrheal illnesses Whipple disease (T. whipplei): Constellation of arthralgias (can be the first symptom to appear), weight loss, chronic intermittent diarrhea, abdominal pain Dx: upper endoscopy with biopsy with PAS and PCR testing for T. whipplei, can sometimes also do testing from synovial fluid/lymph nodes/etc Tx: CTX 2g IV daily or PCN 2 MU IV q4h x 2 wks followed by Bactrim 1 DS tablet bid x 1 yr Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO): Presents with bloating, abdominal discomfort, watery diarrhea More commonly seen in pts with intestinal motility disorders, chronic pancreatitis, post-surgical changes (adhesions/strictures/blind loops) Immunocompromised pts: consider CMV, MAC, TB, fungal etiologies, cryptosporidium Tx: Rifaximin 1650mg qdaily for 14 days H. pylori (see GI section) Acute cholangitis (see GI section): Viral Hepatitis (A-E): Also consider HSV (especially in pregnancy), VZV, EBV, CMV though less common and usually seen more in immunocompromised pts Evaluation HAV, HBV, HCV IgG with PCR, HDV, HEV, EBV Qt, CMV Qt, HSV Qt, VZV IgM/IgG LFTs: elevated AST/ALT (ALT>AST generally) that often precedes elevation of bilirubin Can present on a spectrum of severity ranging from elevated LFTs to acute liver failure; get hepatology involved early for evaluation and monitoring Hepatitis A Presentation: self-limited, N/V, fever, malaise, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine Transmission: Fecal oral transmission Tx: supportive care, vaccine available Hepatitis B Transmission: perinatal, sexual contact, parenteral Acute: Presentation: Most pts have subclinical hepatitis but can present with serum sickness-like syndrome, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, RUQ pain, elevated LFTs Tx: Generally supportive care unless severe illness, then generally treat with tenofovir/entecavir HBV is less likely to become chronic than HCV Chronic: Presentation: Generally asymptomatic but can progress to cirrhosis and HCC Extrahepatic manifestations 2/2 circulating immune complexes: polyarteritis nodosa, membranous nephropathy, aplastic anemia Tx: entecavir/tenofovir, involve GI/ID, based on development of cirrhosis, ALT, HBV DNA level, immunosuppressed status. Vaccine available Hepatitis C Transmission: parenteral, blood transfusion (prior to 1992), sexual, perinatal transmission USPSTF recommends screening in all adults 18-79 Acute Presentation Generally asymptomatic but may have jaundice, nausea, dark urine, RUQ pain, elevated LFTs Majority of hep C cases progress to chronic infection Chronic Presentation: Nonspecific nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, anorexia, weakness but can progress to cirrhosis and HCC, LFTs not always elevated Extrahepatic manifestations directly related to viral infection: essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, thyroiditis, porphyria cutanea tarda, lichen planus, etc. Tx: antivirals targeted to HCV genotype, however, there are pangenotypic regimens. Recheck viral load after 12 wks Hepatitis D Requires HBV for infection, consider screening with HBV Hepatitis E Presentation: self-limited acute infection with jaundice, malaise, anorexia, N/V, ab pain Transmission: Fecal oral transmission Significantly higher mortality in pregnant individuals HIV/AIDS and ART Authors: Kathryn Snyder and Quinton Taylor Background New HIV Diagnosis ID consult if pt is not on Rogers ID service (important for initiation, follow up [CCC], social work assistance) ART is indicated for all HIV+ pts, regardless of CD4; however, starting ART requires appropriate outpt follow up Lab evaluation HIV viral load and genotype T cell subsets (CD4 Count), CBC with differential, CMP, UA HLA*B5701 testing before using abacavir containing regimen QuantiFERON Gold Pregnancy testing Viral hepatitis serologies Toxoplasma serologies CMP, CBC with differential, urinalysis Other STI screening (Syphilis, Gonorrhea/Chlamydia) Timing of ART initiation Factors affecting timing of initiation Drug toxicity and interactions, risks for resistance, adherence barriers Treatment of opportunistic infections may delay initiation of ART given associated risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) Delay ART for several weeks after initiation of therapy for cryptococcal meningitis, tuberculosis, and CMV retinitis IRIS is a collection of inflammatory disorders associated with paradoxical worsening of preexisting infectious processes following the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-infected individuals. Symptoms are associated with underlying disease. ART plan for overnight admits: okay to continue home ART, special consideration for: Pts with hepatic or renal dysfunction may need dose adjustment Interactions with other newly initiated medications If there is concern for non-adherence, can hold morning dose Combination pills may need to be ordered as separate components Close attention to medication reconciliation to ensure the pt's complete ART regimen is ordered Common key regimens for initiation Most regimens consist of an NRTI backbone (2 agents) plus a 3rd agent Some dual therapy regimens (such as Dovato\u00ae) are non-inferior to standard 3-drug therapy Many pts are started on combination pill regimens, including Integrase Inhibitor based regimens: Biktarvy\u00ae, Dovato\u00ae, Triumeq\u00ae, Genvoya\u00ae, dolutegravir + Descovy\u00ae AIDS Defining Clinical Conditions Author: Rebecca Choudhury AIDS is defined by HIV infection with concurrent absolute CD4 count <200, CD4 percentage <14%, or one of the following conditions (predominately opportunistic infections and HIV associated malignancies): Neurologic/Ophthalmologic CNS toxoplasmosis Presentation: Variable, depending on disease burden/location, may include AMS, headache, seizure, ataxia, and focal neurologic deficits, +/- fever and flu-like symptoms Evaluation: MRI w/ring-enhancing lesions on brain imaging, serum Toxoplasma IgG/IgM and (ideally) CSF Toxoplasma PCR (though CSF Toxoplasma PCR has a low sensitivity). Response to empiric therapy (~90% will have radiographic improvement after 14 days) can also be diagnostic. Brain biopsy may be indicated if diagnostic uncertainty. Management: Pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and leucovorin is the preferred regimen, discuss dosing with pharmacy. Alternative regimens: clindamycin + pyrimethamine + leucovorin, Bactrim, atovaquone + pyrimethamine + leucovorin Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) Presentation: chronic (weeks to months), progressive neurologic dysfunction, particularly incoordination and other motor dysfunction, aphasia, sometimes cognitive impairment and personality changes Evaluation: MRI brain w/patchy areas of demyelination in the subcortical white matter; location is variable, but parietal, occipital, and cerebellar involvement are common. JC virus PCR from CSF. Brain biopsy. Management: Initiation of ART (there is no specific JC virus-directed therapy), IRIS may occur in which case clinical worsening before improvement may be seen. Fatal if HIV goes untreated. HIV-related encephalopathy Presentation: Similar to other progressive dementias, with short term memory loss followed by worsening global cognitive dysfunction, motor deficits, sometimes seizures in late stages Evaluation: MRI w/diffuse cerebral atrophy and/or demyelinating lesions similar to PML. CSF w/elevated protein +/- lymphocytic pleocytosis, with no alternative cause. Send HIV RNA from the CSF, usually + in HIV encephalopathy Cryptococcal meningitis Presentation: Subacute to chronically worsening HA and fevers; meningismus and photophobia may be present but are often absent; rarely, focal neurologic deficits Evaluation: LP to check opening pressure and can send serum and CSF Cryptococcus Ag, CSF culture. Brain imaging may be non-diagnostic Treatment: Induction therapy with amphotericin and flucytosine x14 days (at least), with repeat LP close to end of induction to confirm CSF inflammation is improving and culture is negative (note: Cryptococcus grows well on standard bacterial culture media). Following sterilization of CSF, consolidation therapy consists of high dose fluconazole for at least 8 weeks, followed by maintenance therapy with fluconazole for one year. Pts may require serial LP or VP shunt to manage ICP. Delay ART for several weeks after start of treatment to avoid risk of IRIS. CMV retinitis (with vision loss) Presentation: Blurry vision, focal blind spots, visual field deficits, or scotomas and floaters. Typically begins unilateral, though often progresses to bilateral involvement. Evaluation: Always consult ophtho if you suspect it! May cause complete retinal detachment. Check serum CMV PCR (or vitreous if able) Management: IV ganciclovir or PO valgancyclovir (+intravitreous ganciclovir or foscarnet in severe disease). If not on ART, must delay ART for at least 2 weeks after start of CMV retinitis treatment to prevent immune recovery uveitis Pulmonary Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) Presentation: fever, shortness of breath, cough (usually non-productive), sometimes night sweats and weight loss. Hypoxia out of proportion to exam. Evaluation: CT chest appearance usually bilateral and diffuse with GGOs and cystic lesions of varying size. Large cysts can rupture, causing pneumothorax. Transbronchial biopsy, BAL, or induced sputum with cytology and GMS stain. Sputum Pneumocystis PCR can be done, but this is a send-out with long turn-around-time Consider serum LDH and 1,3-BD-glucan: should be elevated, but are nonspecific. Management: Bactrim is the preferred treatment; PO is preferable as Bactrim is 100% bioavailable. Check ABG on ROOM AIR to consider of adding adjunctive steroids (If A-a gradient >/=35 mmHg and/or PaO2 <70 mmHg). Alternative regimens may include primaquine + clindamycin or IV (NOT inhaled) pentamidine. Pulmonary tuberculosis Presentation: With low CD4, can have upper lobe cavities but also atypical radiographic pattern, including a normal-appearing CXR. Have a high degree of suspicion in any pt with advanced HIV and respiratory complaints. Evaluation: TB skin tests and IGRAs have a high false negative rate in advanced HIV. At VUMC, any pt with HIV and respiratory complaints must be placed on airborne until TB ruleout- 3 sputum mycobacterial smears/cultures collected at least 8 hours apart (or 2 smears/cultures with 1 GeneXpert) . If concentrated smear is negative x3, TB is unlikely (though have to follow up final culture to be sure). Management: RIPE therapy is the standard initial treatment, with adjustment if needed for drug resistance or contraindications Herpes simplex tracheobronchitis and/or pneumonitis/pneumonia Evaluation: bronchoscopy with positive HSV PCR from BAL +/- lung biopsy. (Usually associated with HSV-1) Management: agent and duration not well defined for bronchopulmonary disease; depending on severity of presentation, likely IV acyclovir to start followed by transition to PO antiviral once evidence of clinical improvement, for a total of 10-14 days. Gastrointestinal Esophageal candidiasis Presentation: Dysphagia, odynophagia or both. Concurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis (\"thrush') is common but not universal. Evaluation: Typically presumptive. Treatment is the test; start fluconazole and consider EGD if symptoms do not improve after several days (in which case candidiasis may be severe, or it might not be the cause) Management: Fluconazole; nystatin is ineffective, especially in the severely immunocompromised Herpes simplex esophagitis Evaluation: EGD shows diffuse ulcerations throughout the esophagus; in severe disease ulcers may coalesce into dark patches, \"black esophagus.\" Esophageal biopsy is definitive, but can infer based on EGD appearance and serum studies. Management: Similar to other mucocutaneous infections, consider IV acyclovir at first and transition to PO once clinically improved CMV esophagitis/enteritis/colitis Presentation: GI bleeding (colitis) or dysphagia and odynophagia (esophagitis) Evaluation: serum CMV PCR, consult GI for consideration of EGD/colonoscopy Management: (val)ganciclovir, foscarnet if ganciclovir resistance or contraindication Chronic (>1 mo) intestinal isosporiasis Evaluation: Stool ova/parasite can capture Iospora belli (new name Cystoisospora belli), may need serial analysis due to intermittent shedding. Oocysts may also be seen on duodenal biopsy. Management: Bactrim; pyrimethamine + leucovorin if Bactrim is contraindicated Chronic intestinal cryptosporidiosis Presentation: Diarrhea; may infect respiratory tract, causing nonproductive cough Evaluation: on GiPP or Cryptosporidium Ag Management: Early initiation or optimization of ART; Monotherapy with nitazoxanide is preferred; raising CD4 count >100 is necessary to cure infection Recurrent Salmonella septicemia Generally sensitive to fluoroquinolones, but if not clinically improving as expected you can request sensitivities from the microbiology lab. Neoplastic Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma DLBCL, Burkitt's, immunoblastic (subset of DLBCL), primary effusion lymphoma, and 1\u00ba CNS Kaposi's sarcoma Presentation: Distinctive mucocutaneous lesions, usually raised, papular, violaceous or darkly colored, non-tender and non-pruritic. Can also involve the visceral organs (esp lungs and GI tract) and deep lymphatic system. Evaluation: clinical, tissue biopsy for staging, HHV-8 serum PCR. Management: Limited mucocutaneous disease may resolve with initiation/optimization of ART, but widespread or resistant disease may require additional local therapies (eg: radiation) or systemic chemo Bacillary angiomatosis (caused by Bartonella) may present similarly, but can be distinguished from KS on biopsy. It is neither a cancer nor an AIDS defining clinical condition, and is usually treated with doxycycline. Cervical cancer Presentation, diagnosis, and treatment are essentially the same as in HIV-negative pts, but incidence is higher and disease progression is often more rapid Multisystem/Miscellaneous Extrapulmonary or disseminated Mycobacterial infection (TB and non-TB) TB can go everywhere; some notable extrapulmonary sites include lymph nodes (e.g., scrofula), bones and joints (e.g., Pott's disease of the spine), pleura and pericardium, GU tract, and CNS. Dx can come from tissue culture and sometimes MTB PCR for more rapid detection (needs ID approval). TB-IRIS may be severe (esp with high infection burden) and hard to distinguish from TB treatment failure; can also be seen in adequately treated TB (provoked by the presence of dead bacteria) and undiagnosed latent TB. Disseminated MAC is usually diagnosed with AFB blood culture (only 1 positive needed). Think about it in pts with uncontrolled HIV and severe immunosuppression (esp CD4 <50), with unintentional weight loss, chronic diarrhea and/or dyspnea, and evidence of GI malabsorption or with bone marrow suppression Extrapulmonary or disseminated Histoplasmosis, Cryptococcocosis, and Coccidiodomycosis Can be difficult to distinguish based on clinical presentation and imaging alone. Diagnosed by culture and/or antigen testing depending on the organism and site of infection, and diagnosis may be supported by serologic studies.

Pts with known exposure (INH 300mg + pyridoxine 25-50mg) PO daily for 9 months Streptococcus pneumoniae All pts Pts without any previous pneumococcal vaccines: Give PCV15 or PCV20. If PCV15 is used, also give PPSV23 in 1 year. Pts who have already received PPSV23: Give PCV15 or PCV20 one year after most recent PPSV23 vaccine Pts who have already received PCV13: Give PPSV23 Syphilis All sexually active pts Screening for syphilis and gonorrhea/chlamydia with treatment if indicated. Herpes zoster (shingles) Pts > age 50 Shingrix (recombinant zoster) vaccine series Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) Author: Hannah Angle Background: An inflammatory syndrome characterized by the worsening of a pre-existing infection in patients with HIV after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation Typically develops between 1 week to a couple months after starting ART Patients with lower CD4 counts and higher viral loads who respond well to ART are at higher risk of IRIS Evaluation: IRIS is a clinical diagnosis Presentation consistent with either a systemic or localized inflammatory response (specific clinical features dependent on underlying infection) Most often seen in patients with significantly decreased CD4 counts who have a profound virologic and immunologic response to ART Infections most associated with IRIS include CMV, PJP, HSV, HBV, HHV-8, Cryptococcus neoformans, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) Need to rule out drug-resistant infection or nonadherence to antimicrobials, bacterial superinfection, or medication adverse effect Management: Prior to ART initiation, must evaluate for all opportunistic infections (OI), especially when an inflammatory response could cause swelling in an enclosed space (cryptococcal meningitis/encephalitis, tuberculous meningitis, CMV retinitis) If these serious CNS infections are identified, initiation of ART is often delayed until OI is well-controlled with antimicrobials IRIS is usually a self-limited syndrome as long as infection is adequately treated Patients with IRIS should continue both ART and antimicrobial treatment for underlying OI In severe cases, glucocorticoids can be used to decrease inflammation Joint Infection and Osteomyelitis Author: Ally Glover Background: If high concern for septic arthritis, engage Ortho before ID. Needs arthrocentesis +/- wash out. ESR/CRP are helpful but nonspecific in diagnosing bone/joint infections Presentation Septic arthritis: erythema, effusion, limited ROM and pain with passive and active ROM Osteomyelitis: often underlying a wound (diabetic foot ulcer, sacral decubitus ulcer) but may be hematogenous as well; probe to bone positivity is diagnostic for osteomyelitis Evaluation CBC (leukocytosis), ESR, CRP Blood cultures Imaging: start with X-ray \u2192 if radiograph is negative for osteo, cannot rule out, need to get MRI. Very helpful if it's picked up on X-ray though due to specificity Fluid studies & gram stain results from synovial fluid if concerned for septic arthritis: usually WBC > 20,000 cells/ microL Management If pt is sick, don't wait for culture data to start empiric antibiotics Gram positives: empiric coverage with vancomycin until ID and sensitivities; MRSA nares being negative does not rule out MRSA skin/soft tissue infection Gram negatives: empiric coverage with ceftriaxone or cefepime if concerned for Pseudomonas. If concern for septic arthritis, consult Ortho, hold AC If a pt has a foot wound with underlying osteomyelitis, talk to Podiatry/Ortho for deep tissue biopsy. If clinically stable, hold abx. IR and CT/US guided procedures don't really do bone biopsies, so talk to surgical specialty first Osteomyelitis abx duration: usually 6 weeks, but can do PO antibiotics based on susceptibilities, ID follow up Septic arthritis abx duration: usually 3-4 weeks Additional information: Septic arthritis mimic: gout / CPPD \u2192 obtain crystal analysis with synovial studies Less common causes of septic arthritis: gonococcal, Lyme disease (order serologies if suspicion is high) Odontogenic Infections Author: Ashley Zeoli Background Consist primarily of dental caries and peridontal disease (gingivitis and periodontitis) that can have local and systemic involvement Streptococcus species, peptostreptococcus, Veillonella, diptheroids >80% of infections Presentation Associated w/ fever of unknown origin (fever > 3 weeks without etiology), bacteremia w/ seeding of heart valves and prosthetic devices Periodontal abscess commonly encountered on wards Evaluation Obtain panorex, use CT for osseous structures If needing additional assistance, consult OMFS Management Pyogenic odontogenic infections: parenteral therapy is favored Immunocompetent: unasyn 3g IV q6 hours (alternative is PCN G with metro) Immunocompromised: zosyn 4.5g IV q6 OR cefepime 2g IV q12 + metro 500mg PO q8 Additional information Who needs antimicrobial ppx prior to dental procedures? - Does the pt have a high-risk condition or implanted device? - Yes? is the pt undergoing invasive dental procedure (manipulation of gingival tissue, periapical region of teeth, extraction, abscess drainage, routine teeth cleaning?) - Yes? Use antimicrobial ppx:: Amoxicillin 2g - No? no abx ppx needed Pulmonary Infections Authors: VASP, Evan Schwartz Acute Bronchitis Background 1-3 wks productive cough, often preceded by URI, may have wheezing/rhonchi Distinct from chronic bronchitis (>3 mos of consecutive cough x 2 consecutive yrs) Distinct from PNA (parenchymal consolidation, fever >100.4F, hypoxia, tachypnea) DDx: COVID-19, post-nasal drip, GERD, undertreated/new asthma, ACE-i induced bradykinin cough, undertreated CHF, acute PE, or new lung cancer Typically a clinical dx; CXR/labs not necessary unless PNA suspected Management Supportive: lozenges, cough suppressants (guaifenesin or dextromethorphan), smoking cessation. Consider albuterol inhaler for wheezing No indication for antibiotics Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) See CAP algorithm (https://www.vumc.org/antimicrobial-stewardship-program/guidelines) on VASP website Background All PNA that does not otherwise meet criteria for Hospital Acquired Pneumonia (PNA that develops \u226548 hours after hospital admission), Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (PNA that develops \u226548-72 hours after endotracheal intubation), or aspiration PNA Healthcare-associated pneumonia is no longer a clinical entity per 2016 IDSA guidelines MRSA Risk Factors: Recent history of MRSA Cavitary lesion or necrotizing pneumonia Post-influenza bacterial PNA Pts with IDU Severe hypoxemia requiring intubation Pseudomonas Risk Factors: Recent history of Pseudomonas Bronchiectasis or structural lung disease Both MRSA and Pseudomonas Risk Factors: Hospitalization AND IV antibiotics in previous 90 days Immunocompromising conditions *Double coverage for Pseudomonas is not indicated in general population; LVQ has 82% sensitivity so not recommended unless isolate proven susceptible Evaluation Sputum cultures prior to abx, consider BCx in select groups (severe pna, ICU admission, cavitary disease, immunosuppression). Rule out flu if the right season, COVID-19, consider RVP if it will change management CURB-65 or PSI can aid in decision between outpt vs inpt therapy CURB65: Confusion, Uremia (BUN >=19mg/dL), RR (>30/min), BP(<90/60), Age \u2265 65 If \u2265 2, hospitalization is recommended. Consider urine pneumococcal Ag, urine Legionella Ag in severe CAP and in certain pts (e.g., neutropenia, asplenia, obstructive lung disease, hyponatremia, diarrhea, or heavy ETOH); CRP, ESR, and pro-calc have not been shown to reliably improve outcomes; however, pro-calcitonin < 0.25 suggests against bacterial respiratory infection and antibiotic discontinuation is encouraged PA/ lateral CXR. If immunocompromised, consider CT chest w/o contrast (does not improve outcomes) Lobar Consolidation - likely bacterial Interstitial Infiltrate - likely atypical vs. viral vs. non-infectious Cavitation - concerning for fungal vs. necrotizing vs. mycobacterial Management Antibiotic Duration: 5-7 days (at least 5 days and improvement with clinical stability) Outpatient management Low Risk (no chronic heart, lung, liver, renal disease, DM, alcoholism, immunocompromise) - Amoxicillin 1g TID High Risk - Amox/clav 875/125 mg BID - Cefuroxime 500 mg BID - Levofloxacin 750 mg daily Inpatient management Severity No MRSA or Pseudomonas Risk Factors MRSA or Pseudomonas Risk Factors Non-Severe/Non-ICU Preferred: Ampicillin-sulbactam 3g IV q6h OR Ceftriaxone 2g IV daily High Risk Penicillin AND Cephalosporin Allergy: Levofloxacin 750mg PO (or IV) daily If cultures are positive, target antibiotics to the recovered pathogen. MRSA Options: Vancomycin (pharmacy consult) OR Linezolid 600mg PO (or IV) BID P. aeruginosa Options: Cefepime 2g IV q8h or Piperacillin/tazobactam 3.375g IV q8h *If MRSA or P. aeruginosa are not recovered on culture, change to routine CAP coverage. If cultures are positive, target antibiotics to the recovered pathogen. Severe/ICU Preferred: Ampicillin-sulbactam 3g IV q6h OR Ceftriaxone 2g IV daily + Azithromycin 500mg IV (or PO) daily OR Doxycycline 100mg IV (or PO) q12h High Risk Penicillin AND Cephalosporin Allergy: Levofloxacin 750mg IV (or PO) daily Addition of steroids per ICU protocol If RPP and Legionella urine antigen (if collected) negative, atypical coverage should be discontinued. If RPP is positive for M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae, doxycycline 100mg PO BID is preferred. If high suspicion for Legionella or positive urine antigen, azithromycin or levofloxacin are preferred over doxycycline. MRSA: Vancomycin OR Linezolid (if no bacteremia) PLUS Pseudomonas: Cefepime 2g q8h or Pip/tazo PLUS Atypical: Azithromycin 500 mg IV (or PO) daily Addition of steroids per ICU protocol If RPP and Legionella urine antigen (if collected) negative, atypical coverage should be discontinued. If RPP is positive for M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae, doxycycline 100mg PO BID is preferred. If high suspicion for Legionella or positive urine antigen, azithromycin or levofloxacin are preferred over doxycycline. Anaerobic Coverage: Do NOT start metronidazole or clindamycin for aspiration pneumonia. Anaerobic coverage should be considered if empyema or lung abscess detected. Transition to PO as soon as patient able to tolerate PO medications and is clinically improving. If patient has concurrent bacteremia, transition after at least 3 days of IV antibiotics. Additional Information MRSA nasal swab has reported negative predictive value for MRSA pneumonia ranging 95% to >99%; consider sending and if negative, discontinue MRSA agent CTX is generally adequate coverage for aspiration PNA without evidence of abscess, empyema, or cavitary lesion on imaging Aspiration pneumonitis does not require abx. Rapid resolution of leukocytosis and stabilization of vitals suggest aspiration pneumonitis. There is low sensitivity of S. pneumoniae to azithromycin (42%) and doxycycline (72%), so these should not be used as monotherapy Check for drug interactions with linezolid (e.g., SSRI, methadone, methamphetamine use) Hospital Acquired Pneumonia (HAP) and Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP) See HAP/VAP algorithm (https://www.vumc.org/antimicrobial-stewardship-program/guidelines) on VASP website Background HAP: Pneumonia that develops >48 hours after admission VAP: Pneumonia that develops >48 hours after endotracheal intubation Evaluation Cultures of blood, sputum, endotracheal aspirate and/or bronchoscopy specimen Consider MRSA nares to help with de-escalation If there is concern for respiratory viruses: send SARS-CoV-2/influenza/RSV (RPP may be considered for immunocompromised patients) Management Initially cover for MRSA and Pseudomonas Antibiotic Duration: 7 days in uncomplicated cases, although specific pathogens (e.g., Pseudomonas) may require longer duration and ID guidance Consider ID consultation if the pt is not clinically improving on empiric therapy or if an MDR pathogen grows from culture If no MRSA isolated and pt is improving, consider stopping vancomycin ASAP There is concern for nephrotoxicity with combination Vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, but data controversial MRSA Coverage Pseudomonas Coverage Empiric Antibiotics: Vancomycin (Pharmacy dosing) or linezolid Cefepime 2g q8h OR Piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375 q8h extended infusion Influenza Background Dx often clinical w/cough, sore throat, sputum/nasal discharge, HA, fever, myalgias, and malaise; \u00b1 N/V/D. Exam with increased flushing, rarely with lower respiratory symptoms. Evaluation During flu season: Obtain COVID/RPP or dedicated influenza PCR; testing is more accurate if obtained within 96 hour of symptom onset CXR if concerned for bacterial superinfection Management Antivirals most effective when given <48 hours from symptom onset; however, recommended to be given if symptomatic despite duration and to all hospitalized pts Oseltamivir 75mg BID x 5 days, peramivir 600mg IV x 1 (needs renal adjustment), or baloxavir (age \u226512) 40mg once (use 80 mg if >80kg) Amantadine and rimantadine are no longer used due to emerging resistance Inpatient COVID-19 Management Author: Aisha Suara Testing Test patients with any new fever, cough, shortness of breath, loss of taste/smell, diarrhea/vomiting, or flu-like symptoms Asymptomatic testing for SARS-COV-2 is no longer required for routine admissions or pre-procedures Exceptions: Admission to 10 CCT, 11N, MCE6, and MCE7 Pre-transplant pre-procedure planning May also be required by post-acute care facility prior to discharge Would avoid retesting those with confirmed COVID-19 within the last 30 days unless they develop symptoms or fall within the exceptions due to risk of lingering detection without contagiousness or recurrent infection Evaluation of Admitted Patients with Symptomatic Acute COVID-19 Please refer to the hospital's current maximum oxygen requirement allowed on the floor to ensure patient is appropriately triaged Basic admission workup for symptomatic, confirmed COVID-19 Labs: CBC with diff, CMP, D-dimer, Ferritin, CRP, ESR, PT/INR, PTT, procalcitonin Imaging: Portable CXR. Consider CTA PE if sudden or rapid worsening of hypoxia Nursing: Strict I/O's to avoid pulmonary edema Enhanced precautions (contact, airborne, eye protection) Management Fluid balance goal slightly net negative to even Anticoagulation/DVT prophylaxis: Current guidelines suggest DVT ppx on admission Would only initiate treatment dose anticoagulation if confirmed DVT/PE Pharmacologic therapies Note: Therapies, indications, and contraindications are frequently changing, please see latest VUMC/VA guidelines for specific indications for these medications or others. For VUMC, REDCap form (https://redcap.vumc.org/surveys/?s=A9E7PXTCADJEA9P8) is required prior to ordering Paxlovid or Remdesivir Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) For use in symptomatic patients within 5 days of symptoms at high risk for progression to severe disease without significant drug interactions Contraindications: Risk of HIV resistance in patients with uncontrolled or undiagnosed HIV-1 infection Substantial drug interactions Dosing: eGFR >60: nirmatrelvir 300 mg (two 150 mg tablets) + ritonavir 100 mg (one 100mg tablet) BID x 5 days eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min: nirmatrelvir 150 mg (one 150 mg tablet) + ritonavir 100 mg (one 100 mg tablet) BID x 5 days eGFR <30 mL/min: use is not recommended Significant drug-drug interactions (discuss with Pharmacy) Remdesivir For use in patients hospitalized with COVID within 7 days of symptoms at high risk for progression to severe disease Contraindications: known hypersensitivity, ALT >/= 10x ULN, on mechanical ventilation or ECMO Dosing: Mild to moderate COVID-19 who may be admitted for other indications but are at high risk of progression to severe COVID 19: loading dose 200mg IV x1 then 100mg IV q24h x 2 days.

Up to 13 million people living in the US with latent TB. Terminology: some discrepancies / evolution of language around TB Active tuberculosis (now often called Tuberculosis Disease) Latent TB Infection (now often called Tuberculosis Infection) Transmission: inhalation of aerosolized droplets from an infected individual Possible outcomes of this exposure/transmission: Immediate clearance by host defenses Primary TB Disease TB infection (Latent Disease) Presentations TB Disease (Active TB) Primary TB (after first exposure) Fever, cough, pleuritic chest pain CXR: hilar/mediastinal LAD, pulmonary consolidation, pleural effusion. Some patients can present with isolated pulmonary cavitations. Reactivation (post primary TB, years after exposure often) Presents more insidiously: fever, cough, malaise, weight loss, dyspnea. There is an overlap with primary TB. CXR: usually involves apical and posterior upper lobe consolidations, often with cavitations Extrapulmonary manifestations: lymphadenitis, pericarditis (can cause tamponade), genitourinary (can cause infertility even in women), peritoneal involvement, and CNS involvement Disseminated TB - Also referred to as miliary TB. Can range from acute to chronic in presentation. - Dissemination is more often seen in immunocompromised hosts (including patients with HIV/AIDS). TB Infection (Latent Disease) - Asymptomatic by definition - The immune system has contained any active disease such that individuals are not infectious - CXR may show old, healed tuberculosis but patient has no history of treatment. This patient would be very high risk for reactivation. Testing & Diagnosis Who to test? - Clinical judgement is key - In general, think about patients about to go on TNF-alpha blocker or a similar biologic, patients with malignancies, patients with newly diagnosed or undiagnosed HIV, patients at high risk due to living conditions (unhoused individuals in shelters, incarcerated patients). Tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) are often used for screening purposes If someone had the BCG vaccine, cannot use TST If you are concerned for symptomatic TB disease, need to get 2 AFB sputum samples with Xpert testing before can come off TB precautions Xpert MTB/RIF detects the MTB rproB gene. Also detects rifampin resistance. 98% sensitive for a single sputum specimen in smear-positive culture-positive cases; approximately 70% sensitive for smear negative culture-positive cases (this increases to 90% if you test 3 samples). Treatment: TB Infection (Latent TB): Different options: - Rifampin (RIF) daily for 4 months (4R) - Isoniazid (INH) and RIF daily for 3 months (3HR) - INH and rifapentine (RPT) weekly for 3 months (3HP) - INH for 6-9 months (alternative if contraindication to rifamycins) TB Disease: Multi drug regimen for at least 6 months for pulmonary TB INH, RIF, pyrazinamide (PZA), and ethambutol (EMB) for 2 months followed by INH and RIF for 4 more months For CNS involvement: 12 months of therapy plus steroids For bone and joint involvement: 6-9 months of therapy For certain patients with drug-susceptible TB confined to pulmonary system: new recommendation that can do a 4-month course where rifapentine (RPT) and moxifloxacin (MOX) 2 months of RPT, INH, PZA, and MOX, followed by 9-weeks of RPT, INH, and MOX If patient has HIV, remember that TB meningitis is one of the infections most likely to result in IRIS, so ART initiation is held in this case These treatment summaries are for non-pregnant patients Non tubercular mycobacterium (NTM) These are mycobacteria species that do not cause tuberculosis or leprosy Ubiquitous in the environment Most well-known species: mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) NTM manifestations in patients: Pulmonary disease Pulmonary MAC Presents usually with cough, weight loss, fatigue Often occurs in patients with underlying lung disease (bronchiectasis, COPD) or patients with prior TB Another common phenotype: women > 50 who are non-smokers More likely to have CFTR mutations Common imaging findings: nodules, bronchiectasis, and/or cavities Diagnosis: symptoms, imaging findings, 2 positive sputum samples with NTM growth or 1+ bronchial washing (if patient symptomatic) Disseminated infections - Most often seen with HIV/AIDS - Disseminated MAC presents usually with fever, night sweats, weight loss - End organ involvement: bone marrow (manifesting as cell line derangements), adenopathy/hepatosplenomegaly, GI (manifesting as diarrhea, abdominal pain), and pulmonary - Diagnosis: AFB blood cultures, culture & staining/path from end organ areas of involvement (i.e. bone marrow biopsy) NTM infections can also present as superficial lymphadenitis or skin infections Treatment Depends on macrolide susceptibility For pulmonary MAC: 3 drug regimen consisting of a macrolide (usually azithromycin), a rifamycin (usually rifampin), and ethambutol. Aminoglycoside also sometimes used depending on type of pulmonary disease Duration of treatment is usually 15-18 months. Depends on how quickly patients can clear their cultures as you need treatment until 2 consecutive sputum cultures are negative for at least 12 months Disseminated disease treatment is more complicated and is affected by ART often in patients with HIV, so reach out to ID ART should be started in individuals with new HIV diagnosis as soon as MAC treatment is started (unless another co-infection prevents this due to risk of IRIS) Sexually Transmitted Infections Author: Lauren Waskowicz Evaluation: Gonorrhea, Chlamydia, Trichomonas Microbial diagnosis is preferred, rather than clinical diagnosis alone Test of choice: NAAT of the first-catch urine in men; NAAT of vaginal swab in women NAAT of pharyngeal or rectal swab should also be performed in patients with reported symptoms and recent sexual exposure. Note this is also routine testing in patients on PrEP. Routine screening should be offered to sexually active patients, as many are asymptomatic Women age < 25 years should undergo annual screening for G/C MSW without HIV infection should undergo screening for G/C if at increased risk MSM without HIV infection should undergo annual screening for G/C NAATs can detect both LGV and non-LGV chlamydia, but cannot distinguish between them ALWAYS Check CDC guidelines to confirm treatment strategy given emerging resistance: https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment-guidelines/default.htm Chlamydia Background Cause: gram negative bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis Most individuals are asymptomatic though spectrum of dx: urethritis, cervicitis PID, conjunctivitis, perihepatitis (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome), pneumonia, proctitis, epididymitis, reactive arthritis, pharyngitis, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), endemic trachoma Differential diagnosis: Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium Management: Doxycycline 100mg BID x 7 days Alternative treatment options (for allergies/severe contraindications): azithromycin (1g PO x 1), levofloxacin (500mg PO daily x7 days), and ofloxacin (300mg BID PO x7 days) Pts who have receptive anal intercourse with positive rectal chlamydia NAAT should receive empiric LGV therapy with doxycycline 100mg BID for 21 days rather than 7. Pts with recent potential or confirmed exposure within the last 1-2 weeks should be treated empirically Pts with persistent symptoms, confirmed infection, and who already underwent appropriate treatment, likely have a re-infection, rather than treatment failure. Test again. Empiric therapy for gonorrhea should be given to pts unless NAAT is negative Instruct patient to abstain from sexual contact until treatment course completed, test of cure not generally warranted Partners should undergo screening and treatment. Expedited partner therapy (giving pt script for their partner(s)) IS legal in TN and can be used when the partner is unlikely to seek medical care. Gonorrhea Background Gram-negative coccus Neisseria gonorrhoeae Spectrum of disease: urethritis, cervicitis, epididymitis, proctitis, pharyngeal infections, conjunctivitis, PID, and disseminated gonococcal infection Management CTX is the only current abx that meets the strict treatment efficacy goals with single-dose therapy. High dose IM ceftriaxone (<150kg 500mg IM; >150mg 1g IM) Same for pharyngitis or conjunctivitis CTX allergies: Azithromycin (2g PO x1) + Gentamicin (240mg IM x1) or Gemifloxacin. Would discuss with ID. Treatment of chlamydia must also be accompanied with gonorrhea treatment when it has not been excluded with molecular testing. Doxycycline 100mg BID for 7 days Pts who have persistent symptoms despite tx should be suspected of having resistant gonorrhea or Mycoplasma genitalium. Test with culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (with or without NAAT). Partners should undergo screening and treatment. Expedited Partner Therapy is NOT legal for gonorrhea treatment in TN. Instruct patient to abstain from sexual contact for 7 days following treatment, test of cure not generally warranted Trichomonas Background Flagellated protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis Most individuals are asymptomatic, although there is a spectrum of disease: urethritis or cystitis, vaginitis, cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease Most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection worldwide Management Female: Metronidazole 500 mg BID for 7 days Male: Single dose of 2g of Metronidazole (Four 500 mg tablets) Due to high rates of co-infection with other STI's patients should undergo a full screening panel if Trichomonas is confirmed Partners should undergo screening and treatment. Expedited Partner Therapy is NOT legal for Trichomonas treatment in TN. Instruct patient to abstain from sexual contact until they and their sexual partner have completed treatment and are asymptomatic. Women should undergo retesting within 3 weeks to 3 months to ensure cure Syphilis Background Caused by the spirochete, Treponema pallidum High rate of HIV co-infection among MSM with syphilis (~42%) Transmitted by direct contact with an infectious lesion during sex (condoms do NOT provide full protection) Can readily cross the placenta Evaluation Test all pts with signs and symptoms, as well as pts who are at increased risk for acquiring infection (pts with sexual partner with early syphilis, MSM, HIV, high risk sexual behaviors, and history of commercial sex work or incarceration) HIV testing should be offered to all pts who test positive Pregnant pts should be screened for syphilis There are two types of serologic tests: treponemal-specific tests (FTA-ABS, MHA-TP, TPPA, TP-EIA, CIA) and nontreponemal tests (RPR, VDRL, TRUST). VUMC utilizes Reverse Sequence Algorithm due to high number of false negatives in traditional algorithm (see diagram below for testing strategy) Treponemal tests typically remain positive for life following infection Nontreponemal quantifies amount of antibody present and can be used to detect titers to assess for treatment. Titers should decline after a pt has been treated. A rise in titers (4 fold) in a previously treated pt should be concerning for new infection. Requires a humoral response, so can be false negatives if immunocompromised False positives: autoimmune diseases, pregnancy, other infections Neurosyphilis can occur at any time after infection. All newly diagnosed pts with syphilis should have a full neurologic exam and if any abnormalities should have an LP sent for CSF-VDRL (specific, but not as sensitive) with reflex to FTA-ABS (sensitive, but not as specific) Any pts with syphilis and vision changes should get an ophthalmology evaluation for fundoscopic exam. Interpretation of Testing: +Treponemal -Treponemal +Non-treponemal Diagnostic of syphilis (completely new or potentially re-infected) Likely false positive -Non-treponemal Likely history of successfully treated syphilis Likely not syphilis or false negative (due to prozone effect*) *Prozone effect: when there is an overabundance of antibodies and they interfere with clumping/formation of antigen/antibody complex so agglutination cannot be visualized Management When positive Treponemal Ab + low positive or negative RPR, it is important to determine prior testing and treatment. For obtaining historical syphilis titers and past treatment records, email syphilis.history@tn.gov with responses to be expected same day or next business day To assess treatment efficacy, goal of a fourfold decrease in titer after treatment Stage Symptoms Treatment Treatment Alternatives Primary Painless (but can be painful) chancre at inoculation site with regional lymphadenopathy PCN G benzathine 2.4 million units IM x1 Doxycycline 100mg PO BID x 14 days OR Ceftriaxone 1-2g daily IM or IV x 10-14 days OR Tetracycline 500mg PO QID x 14 days OR Amoxicillin 3g BID and probenecid 500mg BID x 14 days Secondary Systemic illness with rash (palms, soles), fever, malaise, alopecia, hepatitis, mucous patches, condyloma, pharyngitis Early Latent Infected, but no symptoms.

Can be ischemic or toxic Toxins: endogenous (e.g. rhabdo) and exogenous (e.g. drugs) Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN): usually drug induced (i.e. NSAIDs, PPIs, beta lactam abx), though can also be secondary to autoimmune disorders (i.e. SLE, Sj\u00f6gren's) Infection associated \u2013 e.g., staphylococcal infections (especially in diabetics), streptococcal infections, legionella) Glomerulonephritis Other causes: Crystalline nephropathy: IV acyclovir, tumor lysis, ethylene glycol Small vessel disease: MAHA, TTP, HUS Large vessel disease: Aortic dissection (leading to renal infarction), renal artery aneurysm or other renal artery abnormality. Note, these would suggest bilateral renal involvement or patient with only one functioning kidney Post-renal: can occur at any level of the GU system Ureteral: stones, external compression (malignancy, LAD, abscess) Bladder: neurogenic bladder, malignancy, obstructing blood clot Urethra: BPH, prostate cancer, prostatitis In rare instances, retroperitoneal fibrosis Note, when postrenal AKI is prolonged/untreated it can lead to irreversible intrinsic kidney disease Pre-renal azotemia and acute tubular necrosis comprise the majority of inpatient AKI Evaluation History (carefully evaluate all medications taken + contrast exposure) and volume assessment (physical exam, CXR, TTE) Labs: CMP, urinalysis, urine protein/Cr ratio 500cc-1L IV fluid challenge: If sCr improves to baseline in <48H then the insult was likely pre-renal. If not, then look for other etiologies Evaluate for obstruction: I/O cath, foley, post void residual >250 cc Renal ultrasound: usually to evaluate for post renal or renal vascular etiologies and not warranted unless any of the following No obvious cause of AKI is identified Abrupt oliguria or anuria (think renal vein thrombus or obstruction) High suspicion for bladder outlet obstruction (PVRs might give you same data) Note, add doppler to evaluate for renal artery stenosis (or if working up resistant hypertension) Urine electrolytes FENa <1% or FEUrea <35% (if on diuretics) suggest pre-renal physiology Not needed in the initial work-up of all patients with AKI. If high suspicion for pre-renal etiology, trial fluid challenge and assess response first Less specific in patients with CKD Urine sodium can be used to assess Na avidity: UNa > 40 suggests ATN and UNa < 20 suggests pre-renal. Urine osmolality can be used as a surrogate marker for Na/volume avidity. If UOsm>SOsm = water retention. Role in AKI in clinical trials still unclear. Management All causes Minimize fluctuations in blood pressure Consider holding anti-hypertensive medications, especially ACEi/ARB (remember to determine plan to resume at/after discharge). Note that this hold reflects the uncertainty of hypovolemia as a contributor to AKI, NOT nephrotoxicity. Avoid unnecessary nephrotoxins Dose-adjust medications for changing renal function Pre-renal True volume depletion: IV volume expansion Cardiorenal syndrome: decongestion/diuresis Hepatorenal syndrome: see Hepatology section for more information Post-renal Relieve obstruction based on etiology: I/O cath vs foley. Consider involving urology/IR if procedureal intervention is warranted (i.e. urostomy, percutaneous nephrostomy) Monitor for post-obstructive diuresis (see below) Intra-renal ATN: Supportive care (for rhabdo, see below). Monitor for post-ATN diuresis. If delayed recovery, may need outpatient dialysis Glomerulonephritis: consult AKI service for assistance with biopsy and selecting immunosuppressive agents if needed AIN: review meds, consult nephrology for possible biopsy and recommendations for steroids Infection associated: treat the infection Monitor for renal recovery Suspect concomitant ATN if sCr decreases with volume expansion, diuresis, or relief of obstruction but remains a few points above baseline When to consult Nephrology Urgent indication for dialysis (see \"Renal Replacement Therapy\") Abrupt anuria Cr worsening or urine output inadequate without clear cause Need for kidney biopsy (i.e nephrotic syndrome, RPGN) Additional information Rhabdomyolysis: UA positive for blood but no RBCs on microscopy Toxic damage due to myoglobin Serologic markers of muscle injury: elevated CK, AST>ALT with normal ALK Phos Fluids adjusted to urine output goal of 200-300 mL/hr until CK declines (monitor for volume overload while on fluids) Consider isotonic bicarb for initial 1-2L of IVF\u2192 urine alkalinization reduces precipitation Avoid calcium repletion for hypocalcemia unless symptomatic Post-obstructive diuresis Necessary process to clear accumulated uremic toxins Replace ~50% of urine output to prevent pre-renal azotemia Monitor calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium in severe post-obstructive diuresis Contrast Induced AKI (CI-AKI) Authors: Madison Bandler, Alexa Serino KDIGO Criteria for CI-AKI: sCr increase by 0.5mg/dl or 25% increase in sCr from baseline 48 hours after radiologic procedure where intravenous contrast was administered Background Mechanism of injury: Direct toxic effect leading to tubular necrosis and indirect effects on renal blood flow leading to medullary ischemia 2024 KDIGO guidelines updated the term from contrast induced nephropathy to contrast associated nephropathy, as the association exists but AKI can be precipitated by various factors including hypotension, atheroemboli, and medications that can coincide with contrast administration When someone develops an AKI do your due diligence and evaluate for the usual causes of AKI, regardless of when they were given contrast Who is at risk for CI-AKI? Normal kidney function: incidence of CI-AKI is 1-3% Studies show no increase in contrast associated AKI of patient with GFR > 45 ml/min Pre-existing CKD: Incidence of CA-AKI may be as high as 20% in patients with CKD 4-5 (GFR<30 ml/min) GFR <45 ml/min with comorbidities are at intermediate risk Diabetes Reduced intravascular volume (CHF, decompensated cirrhosis, dehydration) Taking nephrotoxic medications Older age Arterial contrast carries a higher risk of CA-AKI than venous contrast High volumes of contrast media and repeated contrast administration within a short period are risk factors No real sCr or eGFR threshold below which iodinated contrast is contraindicated, especially in patients for whom imaging will alter management (e.g. acute stroke, PE, STEMI) Risk reduction strategies IV fluid repletion: KDIGO guidelines give no clear recommendation for rate or duration for optimal protection, but do recommend IV isotonic crystalloid over oral hydration. No differences in major adverse kidney events with normal saline vs. isotonic sodium bicarb American College of Radiology guidelines recommend the use of intravenous isotonic saline at an infusion rate of 100 ml per hour for 6 to 12 hours before and 4 to 12 hours after angiography. The European Society of Cardiology guidelines suggest a rate of 1 to 1.5 ml per kilogram per hour for 12 hours before and up to 24 hours after the procedure Rate and duration can be decreased based on the risk for hypervolemia POSEIDON trial investigated the efficacy of hemodynamic-guided fluid administration to prevent CA-AKI in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. This randomized, parallel-group, single-blind trial compared a standard fluid administration protocol with a protocol guided by left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) Both groups received 0.9% isotonic saline at 3 mL/kg for 1 hour before the procedure. The control group continued with isotonic saline at 1.5 mL/kg/hr during and for 4 hours after the procedure. The LVEDP-guided group received isotonic saline at rates adjusted based on LVEDP: 5 mL/kg/hr for LVEDP <13 mm Hg, 3 mL/kg/hr for LVEDP 13-18 mm Hg, and 1.5 mL/kg/hr for LVEDP >18 mm Hg. Incidence of CA-AKI was significantly lower in the LVEDP guided group Typically recommend holding diuretics prior to contrast administration, but if patient is volume up, consider administer diuretic and fluid at a rate that matches urine output Management Medication management: Consider holding nephrotoxic medications such as NSAIDs, RAAS inhibitors, diuretics, zoledronate, methotrexate etc. in people with AKI or eGFR <30 for 24 hours before and 48 hours after contrast administration Pharmacologic intervention: High-dose statins, with or without N-acetylcysteine (NAC), have shown potential benefits in reducing the incidence of contrast-induced AKI Use low-osmolality or iso-osmolality contrast whenever possible and minimize contrast volume Never delay a necessary procedure or image out of concern for worsening renal function Iodinated contrast in CKD-5/ESRD patients While hemodialysis can remove contrast media, it is not recommended as a prophylactic measure to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy due to the rapid onset of kidney damage post-contrast administration Avoid giving if you are trying to preserve residual kidney function in ESRD particularly with patients on PD Gadolinium contrast for MRI The risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) has been significantly reduced with the use of newer gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCAs) that have a higher binding affinity for free gadolinium, such as group II and III agents. Contemporary studies have not reported any new cases of NSF with the use of these agents, though there remains concern about gadolinium deposition in the brain and a possible systemic syndrome attributed to GBCAs, which warrants consideration of alternative imaging modalities when feasible If a patient with eGFR <30 mL/min per 1.73m\u00b2 requires contrasted MRI discuss with Nephrology Approach to Chronic Kidney Disease Author: Terra Swanson Definition of CKD Decreased kidney function or one or more markers of kidney damage for 3 or more months History of kidney transplant GFR < 60.

Customizable to treat specific electrolyte and acid-base derangements Effluent: fluid removed during dialysis or ultrafiltration Ultrafiltration Hydrostatic pressure \"pushing\" water through a membrane. There is no dialysate solution used during ultrafiltration. There is some associated cponvective clearance, as solutes are removed via solvent drag. The effluent in this case is isotonic to plasma. Total ultrafiltration (UF): overall ultrafiltration volume produced during treatment UF net: net ultrafiltrate volume removed from the patient by the machine. The overall volume can be completely replaced (net even), partially replaced, or not replaced at all. UF net is the difference between UF and the volume replaced in the circuit Timing of dialysis: There are several studies in this space (IDEAL, IDEAL-ICU, AKIKI, STARRT, ELAINE). In both the outpatient and the inpatient setting, there is no compelling evidence that early start dialysis improves mortality compared to later starts Outpatient modalities Intermittent hemodialysis (iHD) In home hemodialysis Peritoneal dialysis (PD) If someone with ESRD is admitted Urgent ESRD consult if acute need (AEIOU), otherwise can consult them routinely Routine orders include MWF phos checks and a renal diet For PD patients, their diet can be more liberal and include low phos only or even regular diet (Can just ask what diet he/she follows at home) Acute Setting Indications (AEIOU): AKI leading to life-threatening changes in fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance or toxic ingestion Acidosis: severe metabolic acidosis (serum pH<7.1) refractory to correcting volume status or other electrolyte derangements Electrolytes: severe hyperkalemia >6.5 despite medical management (e.g. loop diuretics, IV fluids, GI cation exchangers, correcting acidemia, etc.) Intoxication: dialyzable toxins and medications Alcohols: ethylene glycol, methanol, isopropyl alcohol, diethylene glycol, and propylene glycol Medications: lithium, salicylates, valproic acid, phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, vancomycin, aminoglycosides, etc. Overload: Severe fluid overload (e.g. pulmonary edema) refractory to diuretics Uremia: uremic complications include encephalopathy, pericarditis, platelet dysfunction Can perform furosemide stress test to help predict who is likely to recover kidney function If Lasix na\u00efve, administer 1mg/kg as a bolus. If on a loop diuretic, administer 1.5 mg/kg as a bolus If within the hour they have made 200 cc of urine, then they are likely to regain kidney function Modalities iHD: Ideal for removal of toxins (e.g. alcohols, dialyzable meds). Use with caution in hypotensive patients CRRT: Set a rate of volume removal (typically 0-200 cc/hr)\u2192 less rapid fluid/electrolytes shifts\u2192 better tolerated in patients with hemodynamic instability Anti-coagulation options to prevent clotting of circuit None Heparin (preferred).

Can also be asymptomatic Important history to obtain: recent contamination, accidental disconnection, endoscopic or gynecologic procedure, as well as the presence of constipation or diarrhea Definitive diagnosis requires 2 of the following: Clinical features consistent with peritonitis, Positive dialysis effluent culture, Dialysis effluent with WBC > 100 with PMN > 50% Evaluation Examine catheter exit site Culture peritoneal fluid (requires specific technique, done by Nephrology) Peritoneal cell count with diff, gram stain and culture Obtain peripheral blood cultures if there is concern for sepsis Management (requires Nephrology involvement) All PD orders, intraperitoneal antibiotics, and prescription adjustments should be directed by ESRD consult service (page them overnight if concerns) Treatment with intraperitoneal antibiotics should be started immediately after specimens have been obtained if there is high clinical suspicion Empiric antibiotics regimen should cover both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, typically with Vancomycin and third generation cephalosporin Systemic antibiotics are generally not necessary unless pts have systemic signs of sepsis Patients with relapsing, recurrent or repeat peritonitis will likely need catheter removal Secondary prevention Treatment with intraperitoneal OR IV antibiotics (for any infection requiring > 1 dose of antibiotics) requires prophylaxis for fungal peritonitis with either Nystatin 400,000 to 500,000 units orally TID Fluconazole 200 mg every other day or 100 mg qdaily Dialysate should be drained the day of endoscopies or gynecological procedures Intravenous Fluids Author: Chandler Montgomery Indications for IV fluid Restoration or maintenance of tissue perfusion Correction of electrolyte abnormalities Nutritional supplementation in those without reliable enteric access Categorized into crystalloids and colloids Crystalloid = water + electrolytes Colloid = water + proteins/large molecules Terms Osmolality: osmoles of solute per L of solution Tonicity: ability to induce movement of water across a membrane (i.e., effective osmolality) Buffer: anions such as lactate, acetate, gluconate which are metabolized to bicarbonate in vivo with the goal of sustaining normal plasma pH Crystalloids Isotonic fluids used for volume resuscitation After ~ 30 mins, redistribute such that only 25% remains w/in intravascular space Balanced solutions (e.g. Lactated Ringer's [LR], Plasma-Lyte)= have electrolytes concentrations similar to plasma NS may lead to renal vasoconstriction, AKI, hemodynamic instability, increased mortality SMART and SALT-ED: balanced solutions had lower rates of death, new renal replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction compared to NS Situations where NS may be preferred Cerebral edema/traumatic brain injury Hypovolemic hyponatremia Pre-existing hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis (e.g. after vomiting or over diuresis) Notes on LR The small amount of K in LR (~4 mEq/L) is unlikely to significantly exacerbate hyperkalemia Lactate in LR is sodium lactate.

Evaluate for secondary disorders Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis (AGMA) Background Na+ is the predominant cation in normal plasma. Cl- and HCO3- are the predominant anions. There are anions that are not directly measured (e.g. most binding globulins, immunoglobulins, clotting factors, and other proteins). These unmeasured anions are responsible for the normal anion gap of ~12 meq/L. When there are extra unmeasured anions within the plasma, the anion gap increases Differential GOLDMARK: Glycols, oxyproline (acetaminophen metabolite), L-lactate, D-lactate, methanol, ASA, renal failure/uremia, ketoacids Evaluate for secondary disorders Corrected bicarbonate Corrected HCO3 = patient's HCO3 + (patient's anion gap - 12) Corrected HCO3 > 26, coexisting metabolic alkalosis, Corrected HCO3 < 22 coexisting non-AG metabolic acidosis Osmolar Gap If there is an anion gap, it is worthwhile to always calculate an osmolar gap. You will be surprised the number of toxic ingestions you catch this way Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis (NAGMA) Differential HARDUP: hyperalimentation (starting TPN), acetazolamide use, RTA, diarrhea, uretosigmoid fistula, pancreatic fistula There are two places from which people can waste bicarbonate- the kidneys and the gut The urine anion-gap, which corresponds to unmeasured urinary NH4+ (primary means of renal acid excretion), can differentiate between the two. Urine anion gap (only useful In setting of NAGMA) = Unmeasured cations (NH4+) \u2013 unmeasured anions = UNa + UK \u2013 UCl Positive value \u25ca low NH4+ \u25ca renal losses RTA Carbonic anhydrase inhibition: acetazolamide, topiramate Adrenal insufficiency Normal saline infusion Ne-GUT-ive value \u25ca high NH4+ \u25ca kidneys working appropriately \u25ca GI losses Diarrhea Pancreatic fistula Ureterosigmoidostomy Caveat: Proximal RTA has a normal distal urine acidification and has a negative urine AG Managing Metabolic Acidosis Lactic acidosis is the most common cause AGMA that we encounter In general, avoid use of bicarbonate to treat lactic acidosis Remember: H+ + HCO3- <-> H2CO3 <-> H2O + CO2. While administering bicarbonate will transiently improve pH, carbonic acid will eventually form and ultimately worsen acidemia In acute NAGMA, reasonable to give bicarbonate when bicarb <12 or pH <7.1-7.2 Pay close attention to other electrolyte levels, especially K+ as it shifts back into cells Metabolic Alkalosis Background Metabolic alkalosis occurs as a primary disorder or as compensation for respiratory acidosis. A thorough history and exam can usually clarify which of these two scenarios is occurring In order for metabolic alkalosis to occur, there has to be both an inciting phase (e.g. volume depletion) and a maintenance phase (e.g. hypochloremia or hypokalemia) Presentation Most symptoms of metabolic alkalosis (confusion, nausea, vomiting, tremors) occur as a result of other electrolyte abnormalities (hypocalcemia, hypokalemia) Serum pH of >7.55 is likely the threshold where symptoms will develop Causes Saline responsive (e.g. hypochloremia) True volume depletion NG suction/nausea/vomiting Diuretic use Saline refractory Hypokalemia Milk-alkali syndrome Mineralocorticoid excess states Bartters syndrome Gitelman's syndrome Treatment Saline responsive/hypochloremia If volume deplete, then normal saline is treatment of choice If alkalosis develops in setting of diuresis, then make sure replacing KCl and consider acetazolamide Saline refractory Hypokalemia: replenish potassium stores Hyperaldosteronism: see Endocrinology section for more detail Bartter syndrome and Gitelman syndrome: replace electrolytes and refer to Nephrology Electrolytes Hypercalcemia Authors: Trevor Stevens, Madison Bandler Evaluation Total serum calcium >10.5 (normal 8.5-10.5g/dl) Most (99%) Ca2+ is anhydrous and stored in bone. The remaining 1% is 60% bound (mostly to albumin) and 40% ionized and able to exert a physiologic effect There is an inverse relationship between pH and free Ca2+. As pH declines, serum Ca increases due to H+ binding to albumin and releasing Ca2+ Don't forget to correct calcium level if hypoalbuminemia (or check ionized calcium level) Corrected Ca2+ = ((Normal albumin \u2013 Patient's albumin) x 0.8)) + Patient's Ca2+ It is not unusual to have pseudohypercalcemia in the setting of dehydration due to an increased concentration of albumin, in which case ionized calcium would remain normal Hypercalcemia of malignancy may occur through multiple mechanisms: Osteolytic lesions (as in multiple myeloma or bony metastatic disease) Activation of vitamin D (as in lymphoma) PTHrP mediated (most commonly squamous cell carcinoma of lung, head and neck/renal and bladder cancer/breast and ovarian cancer) Presentation Ca2+ > 12 can cause shortened QT interval, 2nd and 3rd degree heart block, ventricular arrhythmias, and ST elevations mimicking MI Severe manifestations uncommon at Ca2+ < 14 \"Stones, bones, thrones, belly groans, and psychiatric overtones\" Bone pain, Polydipsia/polyuria: due to nephrogenic DI, Nausea/constipation, Depressed mood/cognitive impairment, Decreased level of consciousness Physical Exam Examine mucous membrane dryness Eye exam for band keratopathy or corenal degeneration from calcium deposits if chronic Skin exam for calcinosis cutis GI exam for abdominal tenderness MSK exam for bone pain, especially along spine GU exam for CVA tenderness suggestive of kidney stones Labs & Imaging PTH level can help distinguish between PTH-dependent and PTH-independent causes of hypercalcemia Normal or \u2191 PTH Primary hyperparathyroidism: \u2191 Ca+2 and \u2193 PO4-3 Tertiary hyperparathyroidism (autologous secretion of PTH in CKD/ESRD) Familial hypercalciuric hypercalcemia (often asymptomatic, no treatment required) Li toxicity \u2193 PTH Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (PTHrP) Malignancy (boney metastases) Excess vitamin D intake Granulomatous disease: 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, or ACE level Milk-alkali syndrome Medications (classically HCTZ) Thyrotoxicosis Adrenal insufficiency Serum phosphate, creatinine, and alkaline phosphatase levels to assess renal function and bone turnover Remember- phosphorus should be lower end of normal if hypercalcemia is PTH dependent Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels can help identify vitamin D-related causes of hypercalcemia, such as vitamin D intoxication or granulomatous diseases 24-hour urinary calcium excretion helps differentiate primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) from FHH. In PHPT, urinary calcium excretion is typically normal or elevated, whereas it is low in FHH Imaging studies, such as neck ultrasound or Tc-sestamibi scan may be indicated to localize parathyroid adenomas in cases of primary hyperparathyroidism Bone density measurement, particularly at the distal third of the radius, and renal ultrasound to detect nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis Management If Ca+2 < 12 and asymptomatic Encourage PO hydration Normal saline if hypovolemic NS provides a higher sodium load that LR Sodium delivery to the distal tubule enhances calcium clearance by the kidneys Evaluate for underlying cause If Ca+2 > 12 with symptoms or Ca > 14 Trend Ca q8 hrs, EKG, monitor on telemetry; strict I/Os \u00b1 foley catheter Volume expansion with NS bolus followed by continuous infusion at ~ 200cc/hr Goal UOP 100-150cc/hr Add loop diuretic (Lasix) once patient is volume expanded Bisphosphonates Zoledronic acid 4mg IV (EGFR >60) given over 15 minutes normalized calcium in 80-90% of patients over 48-72 hours, with a median treatment duration of 30-40 days. Pamidronate 90mg IV (EGFR 15-60) given over 2 hours normalizes calcium in 60-70% of patients over 48-72 hours, with a median treatment duration of 11-14 days If Ca+2 >14 or neurologic symptoms, consider subq (not intranasal) calcitonin VUMC: requires approval from an oncology or endocrine attending Tachyphylaxis after ~48H If etiology of hyperparathyroidism is due to primary hyperparathyroidism, indications for parathyroidectomy include: Age <50 Calcium level >1mg/dL above ULN Renal dysfunction Kidney stones or high risk of kidney stones Fragility fractures or osteoporosis Additional Information CHF: consider early addition of a loop diuretic, especially if volume overloaded ESRD with hypercalcemia (rare), oliguric AKI not responsive to IVF, or severely elevated Ca 16-18: consult Endocrine and Nephrology early Sarcoidosis or lymphoma: consider glucocorticoids Hypocalcemia Author: Trey Richardson Background Can be divided into low PTH and high PTH states Low PTH Magnesium deficiency Post-operative for parathyroidectomy DiGeorge syndrome Medications: bisphosphonates, denosumab, aminoglycosides, gadolinium Infiltrative disease: sarcoid, hemochromatosis, malignancies Autoimmune hypoparathyroidism CRRT (if using regional citrate anticoagulation) High PTH Late-stage CKD Hyperphosphatemia Vitamin D deficiency Alkalemia (Serum Ca is inversely proportional to pH) Pseudohypoparathyroidism/Parathyroid resistance Consumption/deposition: pancreatitis, rhabdomyolysis, some osteoblastic metastases Sepsis or critical illness Presentation Chvostek (facial muscle twitching), Trousseau's sign (carpopedal spasm) , laryngospasm, seizures, widened QRS and arrhythmias Hemodynamic instability Evaluation Check PTH, albumin, iCal, VBG, Vitamin D Review medications for possible offenders Management Under most circumstances there is no need to replace calcium. Instead, focus on correcting the underlying perturbation (e.g. acidemia, hypomagnesemia, treating pancreatitis, etc. ) If hemodynamic instability, cardiac electrical instability, or seizures, then aggressive intravenous replacement is warranted. Also consider preemptive repletion for patients requiring high-volume of blood transfusions (citrate in blood products can cause hypocalcemia) 1 g of CaCl is equivalent to 3 grams of Ca Gluconate Avoid treatment in hyperphosphatemia, advanced CKD/ESRD, and rhabdomyolysis Hypernatremia Author: Lauren Chan Overview of dysnatremias Fluctuations in serum Na reflect fluctuations in plasma free water Sodium is the major driver of tonicity. The clinical signs and symptoms of serum Na fluctuations are related to changes in tonicity with most profound effects on cerebral tissue Two major mechanisms maintain plasma osmolarity between 275 and 290: Thirst and secretion of ADH. When these mechanisms malfunction, dysnatremias occur Background Definition: Na+ >145 Hypernatremia = decreased free water Almost always due to inadequate free water intake (ICU patients, dementia, limited mobility, tube feeding/TPN, impaired thirst/adipsia from hypothalamic stroke). Hospital acquired hypernatremia is iatrogenic and correlates with poor outcomes Can also occur from: Na+ overload (salt poisoning, iatrogenic from NS infusion, over correction), osmotic diuresis (hyperglycemia, SGLT-2 inhibitors, urea, mannitol), diabetes insipidus Presentation Lethargy, irritability, confusion Seizures, coma, hemorrhagic stroke, or subarachnoid hemorrhage (from the effects of hypertonic serum on cerebral vasculature) Evaluation Step 1: Treat underlying cause (vomiting, hyperglycemia, medications) Step 2: Determine volume status. If severely hypovolemic, the patient will need IV crystalloid to restore volume in addition to free water Step 3: Estimate and replace free water deficit (FWD): FWD = TBW x [(serum Na/140) - 1] Step 4: Account for ongoing insensible losses and electrolyte free water clearance Rule of thumb for accounting for electrolyte free water clearance. This is in addition to replacing free water deficit 0-1 Liter of urine output: ignore, no need to replace 1-3 Liters of urine output: replace half of the losses More than 3 liters of urine output: replace all urine losses No evidence that overcorrecting hypernatremia is harmful. In fact, there is increased mortality with overly cautious correction or under correction If able, replace free water enterally. Otherwise, administer D5W intravenously Additional Information Suspected DI: Consult Nephrology (may require desmopressin or may receive desmopressin once stabilized to differentiate between central and nephrogenic DI) Hypokalemia: giving K decreases total amount of free water you are giving the patient Hyponatremia Author: Lauren Chan Background Definition: Mild: Na+ 130-134 Moderate: Na+ 125-129 Severe: Na+ <125 Hyponatremia occurs when free water reabsorption (i.e ADH is on) or intake exceeds free water excretion Presentation Mild to moderate symptoms: lethargy, N/V, dizziness, confusion, fatigue, cramping Severe symptoms: obtundation, coma, respiratory arrest, seizure Evaluation and Management Step 1: Serum osm >295: Hyper-osmolar - presence of other molecules that contribute to serum osmolarity - Glucose, mannitol, iodinated contrast - If hyperglycemic, corrected serum Na+ = measured Na+ + 1.6*[(glucose \u2013 100)/100] - If corrected Na+ is normal, treat hyperglycemia; not a water balance problem - If corrected Na+ is low, there is hypotonic hyponatremia + coexisting hyperglycemia - Renal failure (urea) and ethanol: Ineffective osmoles that can freely diffuse across cells and do NOT lead to hyponatremia 275-295: Iso-osmolar - Pseudohyponatremia due to hypertriglyceridemia, paraproteinemia, or lipoprotein X: Serum Na not actually low, due to how the lab is calculated <275: Hypo-osmolar \u2192 step 2 Step 2: Urine osm Surrogate for ADH activity Uosm <100 or Uosm < Sosm - correlates with low ADH (the body is appropriately trying to get rid of water so ADH is appropriately suppressed) - Primary polydipsia: free water intake>output - Tea and toast: lack solute to effectively concentrate urine - Beer drinkers' potomania: mixture of the two above Uosm >100 or Uosm > Sosm - correlates with high ADH \u2192 Step 3 (the body is retaining water, so ADH is elevated) Step 3: Urine Na Is ADH on in the setting of decreased effective arterial blood volume (EABV) or decreased mean arterial pressure (i.e. appropriate ADH)? UNa <20: Low EABV \u2192 RAAS upregulation with Na avidity \u2192 appropriate ADH release - If true volume depletion, then trial 500cc-1L NS bolus and monitor serum Na. IVF bolus \u2192 increase EABV \u2192 decrease ADH release \u2192 \u2191 free water excretion - If edematous state (e.g. heart failure or cirrhosis), then decongestion with diuretics may improve serum Na UNa >40: euvolemic with no stimulus for ADH \u2192 SIADH - SIADH from: n/v, malignancy, meds, surgery, pulmonary disease, hormones, pain, bladder distension: \u2192 ADH out of proportion to stimulus - Treat with water restriction. Can add NaCl or urea tabs if fluid restriction is severe - Water restriction (L/day) = 600 / uosm (600 mEq Na in American diet/day) - Salt wasting: diuretics, cerebral salt wasting (aka hypovolemic SIADH), SSRIs - Get a Chest Xray \u2013 look for treatable pulmonary etiologies (effusions, pneumonia etc.) - Other: hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency If still stumped , can check a FeNa and measure a serum uric acid - FeNa <0.5 % suggests appropriate ADH activity - High uric acid suggests some degree of volume depletion and appropriate ADH activity Rate of correction Acute (<48 hrs) If symptomatic, give 150 cc bolus 3% NaCl up to two times Monitor Na+ q1-2 hr Goal is an initial rapid 4-6 mEq/L correction and then hold May require Hypertonic Saline infusion with DDAVP clamp if at risk of over-correcting Chronic (>48 hrs or unknown, higher risk for osmotic demyelination if corrected too quickly): Goal Na+ correction rate 4-6 mEq/L over 24 hrs (Max 8mEq/L) When to call Nephrology If you are worried about rapid over-correction High risk patients are those with rapidly reversible causes: - Low solute states (Beer drinker's potomania, psychogenic polydipsia, tea-toast) as soon as they decrease their excess free water intake, they will rapidly clear free water - Volume depletion: As volume is replaced and the stimulus for ADH release is switched off, then patients will rapidly clear the excess free water if they have normal underlying kidney function High risk for ODS includes chronic liver disease, Na <105 meq/dL, alcoholism, and malnutrition Consideration of DDAVP clamp Hyperkalemia Author: Mengyao Tang, Amanda Morrison Background Causes: Cellular shifts: acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, TLS, beta blockade Aldosterone deficient states: T4 RTA, primary adrenal insufficiency Decreased distal tubular delivery: volume depletion Decreased clearance: AKI, CKD, ESRD Excessive intake Medication-related: ACEi, ARB, MRA, NSAIDs, TMP/SMX, digoxin, heparin Pseudo-Hyperkalemia: hemolysis, severe leukocytosis Symptoms are rare, but usually manifest as cardiac dysrhythmias Evaluation Confirm hyperkalemia with repeat BMP Check EKG for hyperkalemic changes (sensitivity for EKG findings in hyper K is poor) K+ 5.5-6.5: peaked T waves, prolonged PR interval K+ 6.5-8: prolonged QRS, loss of P wave, ST elevation, ectopic beats K+ >8: sine wave pattern, asystole, PEA, VF Management If EKG changes or signs of instability Calcium gluconate 1g IV (effective within 3-5 min) Stabilizes cardiac membrane for ~60mins SHOULD BE REPEATED HOURLY while hyperkalemic Shift K+ (temporizing measures) D50 with regular insulin 10 units (can order using Adult Hyperkalemia order set in Epic) Use 5 units if there is renal impairment Lasts for 4-6hrs (can be longer in renal impairment) Correct acidosis: consider using isotonic bicarb Beta agonists (e.g. high-dose albuterol nebulizer); lasts 2-4 hrs Note that typical albuterol nebulizer is 2.5mg, need 10-20mg to have an effect Increase K+ excretion Loop diuretic: if the kidneys work, use them If there is AKI or a volume deficit can administer with IVF Volume expansion with IVF: increases distal Na delivery and K excretion. NS and LR are likely equally effective GI cation exchangers Kayexalate (Polystyrene sulfonate): only effective if having BMs. 60g PO q2h until bowel movement (If using oral, ensure patient is having bowel movements and is not obstructed, could cause bowel injury/ necrosis). PO can take up to 6hrs to work. Consider per rectal administration for faster action but DO NOT GIVE WITH SORBITOL per rectum Lokelma (Sodium-zirconium-cyclosilicate) 10 g PO TID for 48 H. Actively exchanges K for Na within the small bowel and works within 2 hours. Remember to stop once the K is normal since can cause hypokalemia. Also keep in mind the high Na content of Lokelma (400mg/5g dose of lokelma). Valtessa (Patiromer) Is an alternative, though not on VUMC Inpatient formulary Hemodialysis: Consult Nephrology early if severe hyper K+ Hypokalemia Author: Peter Thorne, Patrick Steadman Background Potassium (K+) < 3.5 mEq/L 98% of total body K+ is intracellular (majority in muscle cells) Goal: prevent life threatening complication (e.g. arrhythmia), replace deficit, elucidate cause Insulin and catecholamines (beta adrenoreceptors) are key drivers of transcellular shifts H+ and K+ will trade places to maintain electroneutrality Presentation Malaise, weakness, myalgias, decreased gastrointestinal motility EKG changes: Mild: ST segment depression, decreased T wave amplitude Severe: U-waves (most commonly seen in precordial leads V2 and V3) Severe hypokalemia can lead to rhabdomyolysis Evaluation History: decreased K+ intake, increased entry into cells (e.g. elevated beta-adrenergic activity, hypothermia), GI losses, urinary losses (diuretics, hypomagnesemia, RTA, tubular defects, hyperaldosteronism) If concomitant metabolic alkalosis: Normal/low BP suggests diuretic use, vomiting or Gitelman/Bartter syndromes Hypertension suggests renovascular disease or primary mineralocorticoid excess Labs: BMP, CBC, VBG, urine electrolytes, magnesium, POC glucose, CK. Possibly aldosterone, renin, cortisol pending clinical context Imaging: Renal US, CT AP Management Check Mg, replete to 2. Give empirically while waiting for serum Mg K+ preparation (route); replete to 4 Choice of agent: KCl is used for repletion in the hospital PO tablets for mild asymptomatic hypokalemia IV can be given through peripheral (rate is 10mEq/hr, may have burning sensation) or central access K+ bicarbonate can be dissolved and put through G tube Useful in patients with hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis Dose: Normal renal function: 10 mEq K+ is expected to raise serum [K+] by 0.1 mEq/L Significant CKD or AKI: at risk of overcorrection Shortcut: multiply the mEq by the Cr = how much K+ expected to rise Once K+ higher than 5.5, K+ increases much faster and rules above do not apply Hyperphosphatemia Author: Peter Thorne, Amanda Morrison Background Phosphate (PO4-3) > 4.5mg/dL Etiologies Cellular shifts: cellular lysis (TLS, rhabdomyolysis), acidemia (lactic acidosis, DKA) Increased intake/absorption or iatrogenic hyperphosphatemia (over repletion, vitamin D toxicity, use of Fleet's enemas, etc.) Decreased phosphate clearance (acute or chronic renal disease, hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism) Presentation Symptoms are usually secondary to coexistent hypocalcemia (psychosis, seizure, perioral paresthesias, muscle weakness) Can cause acute phosphate nephropathy with phosphate containing laxatives Calciphylaxis if concurrent hypercalcemia (high Ca+2 x PO4-3product) Evaluation Labs: BMP (calcium, creatinine), VBG, Vit D, PTH, PTHrP, lactate Management Acute If renal function normal, can often treat with IVF (promote PO4-3 excretion) Consider need for calcium supplementation (see hypocalcemia section) If renal function impaired and severe hypocalcemia present, consider hemodialysis Chronic Usually secondary to chronic renal failure, goal PO4-3 3.5-5.5 in CKD patients Renal diet (low PO4-3) PO4-3 binders: Ca+2 containing (calcium carbonate and calcium acetate) and non Ca+2 containing (sevelamer, lanthanum, and iron based such as ferric citrate) Sevelamer is significantly more expensive than calcium containing binders Given 3 times daily with meals, started at 800mg (Can be \u2191 to 1,600mg TID) Should not be given if patient is not eating Calcium acetate: started at 1334mg TID with meals Limit dose changes to chronic binders upon discharge Need to avoid calcium containing binders in patients with calciphylaxis Hypophosphatemia Author: Peter Thorne Background Required for metabolic pathways (ATP production) Most renal reabsorption occurs in proximal tubule via sodium-phosphate cotransporter Common causes Internal redistribution, reduced intestinal absorption Refeeding syndrome Alkalemia Phos binders on purpose or inadvertently (calcium, aluminum, magnesium antacids) Excessive loss (diarrhea, CRRT, increased urinary excretion) Proximal tubular dysfunction such as in Fanconi Syndrome Hyperparathyroidism causes renal phos wasting Post-parathyroidectomy leading to hungry bone syndrome Vitamin D deficiency or resistance Presentation Mild hypophosphatemia (serum >2.0) rarely symptomatic PO4-3< 2.0: muscle weakness PO4-3< 1.0: heart failure, respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, seizures Failure to wean from ventilator Evaluation Urine PO4-3 level if cause not readily apparent Calculate Fe PO4-3 ([U PO4-3 x PCr x 100]/[P PO4-3x UCr]) Fe PO4-3 < 5% = normal renal response to hypophos: redistribution or \u2193 absorption Fe PO4-3 > 5% = renal phos wasting Management Caution replacing in patients with impaired renal function.

will need to see Urology for cystoscopy (often done as outpatient referral) - CT Urography is more sensitive than IV pyelogram for renal masses and stones - Pregnant patients: renal and bladder ultrasound preferred over CT - If clots are passed, more likely to be secondary to lower urinary source; high burden of clots poses a risk of obstruction (urologic emergency) - If extraglomerular bleeding with clots: hematuria catheter needs to be placed ASAP (2 valve catheter, 20-24 Fr (!); page urology if nursing unable to obtain) Who needs cystoscopy: All patients with clots and all patients with gross, nonglomerular hematuria in whom infection has been ruled out Nephrolithiasis Author: Madison Bandler Background Formation of kidney stones occurs when urine becomes supersaturated with stone-forming substances, leading to crystallization. This process can be influenced by various factors, including metabolic disorders, genetic predispositions, dietary habits, and dehydration Classified into four main types based on their composition: Calcium stones (oxalate or phosphate) - ~75-80% of stones - Driven by increased intestinal absorption of calcium, enhanced bone resorption, or decreased renal tubular reabsorption of calcium with low levels of urinary citrate further increasing risk Uric acid stones - ~9-10% of stones - Primary risk factors are high levels of uric acid in the urine, low urinary volume, and persistently low urinary pH, which makes uric acid less soluble Cystine stones - ~1% of stones - Occur in setting of genetic disorder with defective reabsorption of cystine and other dibasic amino acids (ornithine, lysine, and arginine) in the renal proximal tubules Struvite stones - ~10% of stones - Typically take months to years to form, more common in women with recurrent UTIs from urease producing bacteria Evaluation BMP Uric acid Parathyroid Hormone level should be measured if primary hyperparathyroidism is suspected, particularly when serum calcium is high or high normal Urinalysis for pH, erythrocytes, leukocyte esterase, citrate, nitrites, urine culture Patients with uric acid stones may have persistent urine pH of 5-5.5 rather than the expected variation in pH of 5 in the morning and 6.5 in the evening Patients with RTAs usually have urine pH of 6.5 Patients with struvite stones usually have urine pH of 8.5 For high-risk or recurrent stone formers, additional metabolic testing is recommended. At VUMC most commonly will see Litholink, which is a send out Labcorp test. This includes one or two 24-hour urine collections analyzed for total volume, pH, calcium, oxalate, uric acid, citrate, sodium, potassium, and creatinine. This testing helps identify metabolic and environmental risk factors, informing dietary and medical therapy Imaging CT abdomen and pelvis w/o contrast is typically first line MR urography (MRU) without and with IV contrast or CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast may be appropriate as the next imaging study if CT w/o cntrast is inconclusive Renal and bladder ultrasound may be used in pregnant patients Management Stones less than 5 mm often pass spontaneously. Follow-up imaging within 14 days is recommended to monitor stone position and assess for hydronephrosis Alpha blockers, such as tamsulosin, may be used to facilitate the passage of distal ureteral stones less than 10 mm NSAIDs are ideal for acute pain control if no contraindications Thiazide Diuretics are indicated for patients with recurrent calcium stones and hypercalciuria Potassium Citrate is recommended for patients with hypocitraturia and calcium phosphate stones, as well as for uric acid and cystine stones to raise urinary pH Allopurinol for patients with recurrent calcium oxalate stones and hyperuricosuria Operative Management Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL): Suitable for renal stones between 10 and 20 mm, especially in favorable anatomical locations Ureteroscopy: An option for lower pole stones between 1.5 and 2 cm, and for stones resistant to ESWL Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL): Indicated for stones larger than 20 mm, staghorn calculi, and stones in patients with CKD Prevention of recurrent urinary tract stones 50% of patients will have recurrent stone at 10 years and 80% will have recurrent stone at 20 years Increase fluid intake to achieve a urine volume of more than 2.5 L/day and adhere to a low-sodium diet Weight loss and exercise Diets consisting of low sodium, low animal protein (source of uric acid), and low oxalate (beets, berries, chocolate, rhubarb, nuts and leafy greens) with no calcium restriction may be beneficial. During a meal it may help to combine calcium rich food with oxalates that will bind in the intestinal lumen and be excreted in stool Adding citrus fruits may increase citrate and reduce stone formation Kidney Transplant Medicine Authors: Trey Richardson, Madison Bandler Introduction The goal of this section is to serve as a guide for tackling the most common transplant complications as well as offer a few tips for managing immunosuppression while kidney transplant patients are admitted to the hospital Alphabet soup PRA: panel reactive antibodies DSA: donor specific antibodies SCD/ECD: standard or expanded criteria donors reflects quality of organ and risk of graft loss DCD: donation after circulatory death DGF: delayed graft function (required dialysis within 7 days post-transplant) CMV (-/+): indicates the CMV status of both the recipient and the donor FK506 or FK: another name for tacrolimus KDPI: Kidney donor profile index used to \"grade\" the quality of the donated organ X/6 MM: indicates the number of HLA subtypes that are mismatched between donor and recipient CAN: chronic allograft nephropathy Infections in Kidney Transplant Recipients Infection Prophylaxis Agent Purpose Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) 80/400mg one tablet daily for at least six months for PJP ppx (12 months for toxo ppx) Routine use reduces or eliminates the incidence of Pneumocystis jirovecii, Listeria monocytogenes, Nocardia asteroids, and Toxoplasma gondii and TMP-SMX is also effective as UTI prophylaxis Monthly IV or aerosolized pentamidine, dapsone* or atovaquone Replace TMP-SMX as PJP prophylaxis for patients with sulfa allergies or if treatment complications such as hyperkalemia or leukopenia arise. *pentamidine and dapsone are not sufficient for toxo ppx Nystatin 100,000 units/mL, 4mL after meals and before bedtime OR Fluconazole 200mg one tablet daily generally 3 months after transplant For fungal prophylaxis. **closely monitor cyclosporine and tacrolimus levels when starting and stopping antifungals (azoles) Valganciclovir for 4-6 months after transplant For CMV prophylaxis (also prevents HSV). *Acyclovir for 3 months for HSV ppx in CMV recipient negative/donor negative individuals Letermovir An alternative for CMV prophylaxis in patients with significant myelosuppression. *would need HSV ppx with acyclovir Background Infections in a kidney transplant recipient can be divided into 3 phases: <1-month post-transplant - Surgical site infections, nosocomial infections (e.g. C. Diff, CAUTIs, and CLABSIs), and donor-derived infections/reactivation of latent recipient infections predominate 1-6 months post-transplant - Depleted immune-system regenerates increased risk for disseminated fungal (e.g. PJP, histo/blasto) and viral infections (HSV, adenovirus) >6 months post-transplant - Risk for atypical infections persists, but common community acquired syndromes should still be on the differential This section will focus on the most common infection in kidney transplant recipients\u2014infections of the urinary tract Evaluation UA with culture Examine the native kidneys (CVA tenderness) AND the allograft (almost always in RLQ, denervated so the graft itself will not be tender, but the surrounding soft-tissue may) Renal U/S (of both allograft and native kidneys) or CT AP if: Early post-op (1 month) Recurrent (2+ episodes in year) History of nephrolithiasis or if sepsis/bacteremia Blood cultures if systemic signs/symptoms Consider testing for C. urealyticum, and sending fungal and AFB urine cultures if UA is recurrently positive but culture negative. Differential includes BK and adenovirus if hemorrhagic cystitis (test urine PCR) Management Remove or replace indwelling catheters Review prior culture susceptibilities (if available) Empiric antibiotic regimens Asymptomatic bacteriuria: treat with fluoroquinolone or beta lactam for 5-7 days if <3 mo post-transplant Simple cystitis: Fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin 250 BID or Levaquin 500 mg daily), Augmentin (500 mg BID), 3rd gen cephalosporin (cefpodoxime 100 mg BID or cefixime 400 mg daily) or nitrofurantoin 100 mg BID (if GFR>30, only treats cystitis since drug only concentrates in the urine) - < 6 mos post-transplant: treat for 10-14 days - >6 mos post-transplant: treat for 5-7 days Complicated UTI/Pyelonephritis (cover Pseudomonas, gram negatives and Enterococcus): Ceftriaxone 2g daily (preferred), Cefepime 2g q8hrs (add Vancomycin when using cephalosporin if suspicious for enterococcus) or Pip-tazo 3.75g q6hrs, can also use meropenem 1g q8h (need ID approval) - Treat for 14-21 days - For stable pts with mild complicated UTI, can consider giving more narrow empiric antibiotics: Augmentin 875 mg BID or ciprofloxacin 500 mg q12h - MDR UTI: Consult transplant ID - Options: meropenem-vaborbactam, ceftolozone-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam - In pts with PCKD, include lipophilic antibiotic (such as ciprofloxacin) to penetrate cysts Viral Infections CMV Most common opportunistic viral infection, typically in the first 6 months post-transplant CMV infection can lead to acute rejection and graft failure May manifest as a nonspecific febrile syndrome, gastrointestinal symptoms, or tissue-invasive infection, which may not cause CMV viremia but requires histologic diagnosis In patients with active disease, weekly monitoring of CMV PCR, CBC and kidney function recommended For severe disease treat with IV ganciclovir vs oral valganciclovir for mild or moderate disease Ganciclovir and valganciclovir are renally dosed Alternative treatments: IV Foscarnet (if resistant to ganciclovir) or maribavir in patients with severe leukopenia or ganciclovir-resistant Check a resistance panel if CMV viral load not improving after first 2-3 weeks of treatment BK Virus Disease manifestations include BKV-associated nephropathy (BKVAN), ureteric stenosis, and hemorrhagic cystitis Monitored by checking serum BK DNA PCR. BK nephropathy diagnosed by renal biopsy Managed by reducing immunosuppression EBV and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) Manifestations can include lymphadenopathy, fever, weight loss, and organ-specific symptoms such as gastrointestinal disturbances or respiratory issues Key risk factors include EBV seronegativity at the time of transplantation, primary EBV infection post-transplant, and the overall level of immunosuppression Monitoring EBV DNA levels may be used for early detection Fungal Infections Candida species infections account for up to 70% of fungal infections in kidney transplant recipients Aspergillus Cryptococcus Pneumocystis jiroveci Histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, and coccidioidomycosis Acute Kidney Injury of Kidney Transplant Background Most patients admitted to medicine services with kidney transplants are >3 months post-op. Therefore, we are typically not managing perioperative complications such as delayed graft function, or hyper-acute rejection. Below are the most common causes of acute kidney injury in kidney transplant recipients Evaluation Signs and symptoms of UTI? Assess volume status Review meds for recent medication changes Common offenders: NSAIDs, ACEi, diuretics, azole antifungals Medication non-adherence Tacrolimus (FK) or cyclosporine (CsA) level FK levels increase with n/v, diarrhea due to alterations in p-glycoprotein expression within inflamed GI tract FK toxicity also causes diarrhea and volume depletion Proteinuria Transplant patients with 1 g/day proteinuria usually get biopsies Review donor characteristics (CMV status, PRA, % HLA antibodies present, DSAs) BK PCR: consider only if unclear source of AKI and no recent titers Serum PCR is test of choice Renal transplant U/S (costly and not always warranted) < 1 week post-transplant: If acute graft dysfunction, look for thrombosis, urine/ureter leak > 1 week post-transplant Cr does not respond to 48 hours of current management Lack of clear, reversible causes Hydronephrosis (can occur after stent removal 4-6 wks after transplant or due to perinephric fluid collection) Arterial stenosis (\u2191 velocities in renal artery -- very concerning when velocity >300), tardus parvus waveforms) Perinephric abscess with recurrent UTI/pyelonephritis Urinoma (usually first 2-3 weeks), hematoma (after a biopsy) Unique findings Resistive indices: Reflect central renal vascular compliance. High indices in transplant patients signify parenchymal problem (rejection, infection, ATN) Biopsy To differentiate ATN vs. rejection vs. BK nephropathy vs. recurrent disease (FSGS, lupus, etc.) Post biopsy care Watch for bleeding and HTN Blood can get into collecting system, then the capsule, and into the perinephric space causing Page Kidney (aka Pressure Tamponade) Compressed renal vessels \u2192 RAAS surge \u2192 rapid, severe HTN (STAT page the renal fellow) Kidney Transplant Rejection Background Rejection is divided into acute vs. chronic and T-cell mediated or antibody mediated - Pathologists can determine the type of rejection and the chronicity by observing the structures that are acutely involved (e.g. tubulitis, glomerulitis, arteritis, and capillaritis) as well as the time course of involvement (e.g. presence of fibrosis) - Structures exhibiting fibrosis represent chronic rejection that is unlikely to respond to treatment, whereas acute inflammation may be amenable to acute therapies - This section will focus on acute rejection since this is the clinical entity we will most likely manage while on the wards Acute Rejection Acute T cell mediated rejection Infiltration of the graft by lymphocytes and inflammatory cells characterized by tubulitis, interstitial inflammation, and arteritis (on occasion) Treatment - High dose glucocorticoids (methyl prednisolone) is first line (~ 5 days) - Thymoglobulin (polyclonal Ig anti-T cell) - Use depends on severity of rejection - Indicated if Cr fails to improve after steroids - T cell subsets are measured during treatment until depleted - Tacro target levels are reset to ~8-10 if treated for acute T cell mediated rejection Acute antibody mediated rejection (ABMR) Donor specific antibody mediated rejection characterized by glomerulitis, peri-tubular capillaritis (microcirculation inflammation), complement deposition (C4d staining), and presence of DSA Treatment = B-cell depletion therapy - IV methyl prednisone 500 mg IV x 3-5 days - Plasmapheresis (If with high titers of DSA) - IVIG 2 g/kg (max 140 g) - Rituximab 375 mg/m2 Kidney Transplant Immunosuppression Background Induction therapy, which is administered at the time of transplantation, includes biologic agents such as rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin, anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab, or the anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody basiliximab, to provide an initial high level of immunosuppression Maintenance therapy is continued long term and often involves triple therapy with an anti-metabolite (azathioprine or mycophenolate compound) or mTOR inhibitor + calcineurin inhibitor + corticosteroids You may also come across patients who are on monthly infusions with belatacept, a selective T-cell co-stimulation blocker Belatacept is only for use in patients who are EBV seropositive due to increased risk of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in EBV seronegative patients Calcineurin Inhibitors Tacrolimus (FK), cyclosporine (CsA) - Envarsus XR is a once a day long acting formulation of tacrolimus Common side effects: - Nephrotoxicity: mediated by vasoconstriction to the afferent arterioles and interstitial fibrosis - Hypertension - treat with CCBs - Diabetes - Neurotoxicity: Hand tremors, headache, seizures, PRES - Diarrhea, nausea - Thrombotic microangiopathy - T4 RTA - hyperkalemia - Gingival hyperplasia (more associated with cyclosporine) MTOR Inhibitors Sirolimus, Everolimus Major side effects: poor wound healing, rarely pneumonitis, dyslipidemia, bone marrow suppression, proteinuria Reduced incidence of nephrotoxicity, lower incidence of certain viral infections and malignancies, and decreased alloantibody production (useful in patients at risk for antibody mediated rejection) relative to CNI's, though there are higher rates of delayed graft function, acute rejection and proteinuria Increases nephrotoxicity when given with standard doses of CNIs so target trough levels are adjusted when patients are on both meds Anti-metabolites Azathioprine Mycophenolate preparations: mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept, MMF), Mycophenolic acid (Myfortic) Side effects: bone marrow suppression (hold if lymphopenia), GI upset (hold if diarrhea) Mycophonolate generally preferred for superior efficacy in preventing acute rejection and improving graft survival, but azathioprine may be considered in specific patient scenarios (pregnancy, G intolerance/IBD, high cost of medications) Additional Information for Overnight Admits: Do not change immunosuppression unless discussed with fellow When to consider holding medications: known CMV infection or COVID infection w/ hypoxia (hold mycophenolate); if pt has multiple signs of CNI toxicity (AKI, severe diarrhea, and tremors/neurotoxicity) If holding mycophenolate/anti-metabolite, prednisone is increased to 10 mg daily Daily tacrolimus or cyclosporine level (order qam at 0500). Always order tacrolimus or cyclosporine dose at 6:00 am and 6:00 pm (regardless of what time patient takes at home, lab can only run am tacro levels at a certain time in batches) *check an everolimus or sirolimus AM level if patient takes an MTOR inhibitor Transplant patients with normal kidney function can have regular diet Renal transplant is consulted on every post-transplant patient admitted to the hospital","title":"Nephrology"},{"location":"Nephrology/#nephrology","text":"Editors: Madison Bandler, Rachel Brown Reviewed by: Ed Gould, MD and JP Arroyo, MD, PhD","title":"NEPHROLOGY"},{"location":"Nephrology/#acute-kidney-injury-aki","text":"Authors: Piera Sosa, Rachel Brown","title":"Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)"},{"location":"Nephrology/#background","text":"Definition based on 2012 KDIGO Guidelines: Rise in serum creatinine (sCr) \u2265 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hrs or increase \u2265 1.5x baseline in 7d Urine volume <0.5 mL/Kg/H for 6 hours","title":"Background:"},{"location":"Nephrology/#stages-of-aki","text":"Based on 2012 KDIGO Guidelines: Stage Serum Creatinine Urine Output Stage 1 Increase of \u2265 0.3 mg/dl (\u226526.5 \u03bcmol/L) or 1.5 - 1.9x baseline < 0.5 ml/kg/h for > 6 hours Stage 2 2.0 - 2.9x baseline < 0.5 ml/kg/h for > 12 hours Stage 3 > 3.0x baseline, or increase in serum creatinine to >4.0 mg/dl, or initiation of RRT < 0.3 ml/kg/h for 24 hours or anuria for 12 hours Patients should be staged based on criteria that gives them highest stage (sCr v UOP) Note, risk of need for RRT and risk of death increases with increased stage","title":"Stages of AKI:"},{"location":"Nephrology/#framework-for-aki","text":"","title":"Framework for AKI:"},{"location":"Nephrology/#pre-renalhemodynamic-aki","text":"Volume depletion: GI loss, hemorrhage, burns, critical illness \u2192 increased insensible losses Decreased effective circulating volume: cardiorenal, hepatorenal, hemodynamic effects of ACEi/ARB Afferent arteriole constriction: NSAIDs, iodinated contrast Renal vein thrombus Note, when prerenal AKI is prolonged it can lead to intrinsic ATN","title":"Pre-renal/hemodynamic AKI:"},{"location":"Nephrology/#intra-renal-glomerular-tubular-or-interstitial-diseases","text":"ATN = Most common form of intrinsic AKI.

Can test attention by spelling \"world\" backwards or by asking for days of the week or months of the year backwards Orientation: to person, place, time, and/or situation Memory/Fund of knowledge: do not need to formally assess unless part of complaint. For memory, can be bedside testing of 3 or 5 word recall after 5 minutes Language: look for aphasia by testing for fluency (can test by naming objects), comprehension (can test by complex commands, eg \"touch your right shoulder with your left hand and stick out your tongue\"), and repetition Cranial Nerves CN1: smell, typically do not test this CN2: vision, check with pupillary light response, visual field testing, or visual acuity if part of complaint CN3, 4, 6: extraocular movements. 6 abducts, 4 raises in and up and helps with intorsion, 3 does rest and is in pupillary light reflex (constricts pupil) CN5: facial sensation in V1, V2, and V3, compare left and right CN7: facial movements/strength, compared left and right, upper (eyebrow raise/eye closure) and lower (mouth such as smile or puffing out cheeks) CN8: hearing. Can do finger rub or just assess grossly when talking during interview CN9, 10: palate elevation symmetry, cough/gag if intubated CN11: shoulder shrug from trapezius and head turn from sternocleidomastoid CN12: tongue protrusion: should be midline. If abnormal, deviates to side of injury Motor Strength: manual muscle testing (MMT) scale ranging from 0 to 5 - 0 = No muscle activation - 1 = trace muscle activation (eg muscle twitch) but unable to move across ROM of joint - 2 = muscle action with gravity eliminated (eg in plane of bed), with full ROM in that plane - 3 = action against gravity only and not against resistance - 4 = action against some resistance - 5 = full strength against resistance Other aspects of motor: muscle tone (decreased, normal, increased), tremor (at rest, with action, or postural), pronator drift, any other abnormal movements (if not sure what it is, just describe what you see), rapid alternating movements (eg bradykinesia, dysdiadochokinesia) If altered or sedated: look for spontaneous movement, compare left and right sides, assess response to noxious stimuli (eg centrally with trapezius squeeze or sternal rub vs peripherally with nailbed pressure) Sensation Light touch is simplest -- is it the same left and right and in uppers and lowers, can also assess for a sensory level (eg compare torso to extremities) Unless sensation loss or changes is part of chief complaint, typically do not assess other modalities which include pinprick, temperature (hot or cold), vibration, proprioception Reflexes Grading scale: - 0 = areflexia - 1+ = decreased but present - 2+ = normal - 3+ = increased without clonus but often with spread to adjacent joints - 4+ = increased with clonus (sustained response to one tap) Increased reflexes often indicate central etiology, but 3+ can be normal in young adults Decreased reflexes often indicate lower motor neuron or peripheral etiology, can be normal in older adults Common Reflexes: - Biceps: C5-C6, musculocutaneous nerve - Brachioradialis: C5-C6, radial nerve - Triceps: C7-C8, radial nerve - Patellar: L2-L4, femoral nerve - Achilles: S1, tibial nerve - Babinski: scrape along lateral edge of foot then across top in a hockey stick motion. Often easier to describe by direction big toe moves \u2013 up or down, can also be mute (no motion of the big toe) Coordination Finger-nose-finger and heel-knee-shin testing, looking for smooth movements vs ataxia or dysmetria, and can also pick up on tremor with FNF Gait Station: can stand still with feet with feet less than shoulder width apart, assess posture Natural gait: Smooth coordinated with normal arm swing Symmetric? Stride length? Narrow or wide based? Speed? Lateralizing findings (ie circumduction, shoulder droop)? Toe walk: tests balance, strength of distal lower extremities Tandem walk (heel to toe): should be able to balance without falling or stepping to the side, can help detect ataxia ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (AMS) Author: Aisha Suara Background Definition: change in a pt's baseline cognition. Medical diagnosis is encephalopathy Can be hypoactive (lethargic) or hyperactive (agitated) Risk factors: Functional impairment (hard of hearing, visually impaired, bed-bound), age > 75, dementia/neurodegenerative diseases, prior brain injury (stroke, TBI), depression, ETOH/substance use disorder, sensory impairment, recent surgery Etiologies: Consider MOVE STUPID Mnemonic M etabolic (Hypo/hypernatremia, Hypercalcemia) O xygen (Hypoxia) V ascular (Ischemic stroke, hemorrhage, MI, CHF) E ndocrine (Hypoglycemia, Thyroid, Adrenal) S eizure (Postictal state) T rauma U remia P sychiatric I nfection D rugs (Intoxication, withdrawal, or medications) Delirium \u2013 see \"Delirium\" section in psychiatry Evaluation Consider broad toxic, metabolic, and infectious workup as appropriate CBC, CMP, BCx, UA with reflex UCx, CXR, Glucose, TSH, UDS, VBG, Vit B1 (whole blood), Vitamin B12, +/- RPR, HIV Review medications Beer's Criteria, sedatives, anticholinergics, benzos/EtOH toxicity or withdrawal Head imaging in the setting of focal neurologic findings: if acute focal deficits, activate stroke alert Start with CT Head noncontrast \u2013 ischemic strokes take up to 24 hours to show up Consider CTA head/neck and MRI if high concern for stroke. MRI if high concern for inflammatory changes or infection LP should be performed if there is any concern for meningitis EEG for fluctuating mental status or seizure-like activity Management Management of underlying etiology Consider empiric high-dose thiamine supplementation See \"Delirium\" section in psychiatry for nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS (ALS) Author: Nicholas Mallett Background Progressive weakness, often asymmetric and profound, with no sensory loss Combination of LMN and UMN findings LMN findings: weakness, flaccidity, hyporeflexia, fasciculations UMN findings: weakness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, pathologic reflexes Bulbar symptoms: dysphagia, increased saliva production (secondary to dysphagia), speech changes Tongue fasciculations are best assessed while tongue rests in mouth and observed for ~30 seconds but can be hard to be certain of (symmetric movements are typically not fasciculations). A light can be helpful and atrophy, if present, can help differentiate from normal movements Pseudobulbar affect (inappropriate laughing or crying) is relatively common in ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders. FVC is an important respiratory marker for function. Evaluation EMG/NCS is gold standard using the El Escorial or Awaji Criteria for diagnosis Exclude mimicking lesions, which may be treatable (see below) Management Pts with ALS are ideally treated with a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, pulmonologists, PT, OT, and SLP Given the extensive specialized care requirements, the Office of Outpt Referral Assistance can assist in getting uninsured pt established with specialists Few medications have been shown to add to survival on the order of months: Riluzole: PO, requires CBC/LFT monitoring, AE: GI distress and general weakness Edaravone: IV, QD x2weeks every month, AE: headache, bruising Sodium Phenylbutyrate: PO, recently approved by FDA (9/2022), shown to delay ventilator-dependence by ~7 months, AE: GI distress Otherwise, symptomatic management Mimics of ALS Primary lateral sclerosis: UMN-only disease, less common than ALS with slower progression. Suspected to be on spectrum with ALS. Cervical spine lesions: UMN changes in UE with LMN pattern in LE. MRI can reveal lesion Multifocal motor neuropathy: rare autoimmune disorder with LMN-only signs. Responds to IVIG. Can be anti-GM1 Ab positive. Kennedy Disease: X-linked genetic disorder with progressive LMN pattern, endocrine disorders, and androgen-resistance symptoms (gynecomastia, defective spermatogenesis) Inclusion body myositis: Can be asymmetric with grip weakness and quadriceps weakness. Biopsy and atrophy pattern usually distinguishes it. CPK typically runs 500-800. Polymyositis/dermatomyositis: proximal weakness in BUE/BLE, CPK typically runs >1000, usually younger onset (30-40s), no UMN signs. BRAIN MASSES Background Neoplasm is the biggest concern: - 90% of malignant brain masses are metastatic - Most commonly: lung, RCC, breast, melanoma - Highest bleeding risk: melanoma, thyroid, choriocarcinoma, RCC Primary brain tumors: - Gliomas: WHO Grade I-IV - Glioblastoma: WHO Grade IV; large heterogenous masses with edema; heterogenous contrast enhancement; can cross the corpus callosum (butterfly pattern) - Lower grade gliomas include oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas - Meningioma: usually low grade - Can be left alone and monitored with yearly MRI - If symptomatic, may need resection/radiation - Ependymoma: uncommon. Can cause CSF outflow obstruction - CNS lymphoma: diffuse white matter involvement with mass effect, diffusion restriction on MRI with prominent contrast enhancement; can cross the corpus callosum - Usually B-cell, initially responds significantly to steroids Presentation A significant number of brain lesions are detected incidentally If a pt has a first-time seizure, brain mass needs to be ruled out with head imaging Symptoms: headache (usually constant, severe), seizure, and focal neurologic deficits Evaluation and Management Imaging: MRI w/wo contrast provides the most information - Findings suggesting malignant lesions: Marked edema, multifocal lesions, or presence at gray-white junctions LP may be indicated if herniation risk is low, particularly if concerned for infection Biopsy (with assistance from Neurosurgery) will ultimately be needed in many cases Management Work up for primary malignancy, including CT C/A/P and PET Steroids are generally indicated for treatment of edema Decadron 10 mg IV to start; then transition to 4mg IV Q6H with SSI and PPI If pt is clinically stable and there is a concern for CNS lymphoma, consider delaying steroids to increase yield of cytology and biopsy, unless edema/mass effect warrants emergent treatment Symptomatic tumors need evaluation by Neurosurgery for resection consideration and Radiation Oncology INPATIENT HEADACHE Author: Lauren Waskowicz Background Important to distinguish primary and secondary headache \"Red flags\" for secondary headaches (SNOOPPP): S ystemic symptoms, focal N eurologic symptoms, O nset that is sudden (thunderclap), O lder age (new headache >40), P rogression or evolution in previous headaches, P ostural component, P regnancy Other red flags: preceding trauma, headache awakening pt from sleep, no headache-free intervals Evaluation Get a good description of where the pain is, when it started, associated symptoms, and assess for \"red flag\" features listed above If there are any red flag features, imaging and possible further workup may be necessary Imaging depends on highest suspicions, but CTA head/neck is appropriate to evaluate for aneurysm, dissection or vasospasm. If any focal signs, MRI is generally preferred; venous imaging can be beneficial in headaches with features of elevated ICP Would consider lumbar puncture for evaluation of opening pressure if features of elevated ICP present and venous imaging negative. Ophthalmologic evaluation for papilledema also appropriate. Would order ESR/CRP and ophthalmologic evaluation in older patients with temporal headache and other symptoms concerning for GCA such as vision changes, jaw claudication If no red flag features are present, then workup is not necessary, and focus is on treatment Management NSAIDs and Tylenol for infrequent headaches, but consistent use (>2-3x/week) runs the risk of medication overuse headaches Triptans for migraine, but contraindicated in patients with CAD, uncontrolled hypertension, previous stroke, hemiplegic migraine. They must be used within 6 hours of onset There are theoretical concerns of serotonin syndrome when used with SSRI/SNRIs Migraines: - \"Migraine cocktail\": 1L fluid bolus, 4g Mg, IV Compazine(10mg) OR Phenergan(20mg) with Benadryl (25mg) - 2nd line: Depakote 1000 mg IV, Decadron 10mg IV, +/- Toradol 30mg IV, Flexeril 10mg PO Cluster headache: - Triptans, high flow O2 (>10 L), can consider intranasal Lidocaine if no arrhythmia history OUTPATIENT HEADACHE Author: Lauren Waskowicz Type Presentation First-line Treatment Tension (most common) Mild-to-moderate visor-like pressure/tightness without significant photophobia, phonophobia, or nausea Abortive: Acetaminophen Preventative: TCAs, SNRIs Migraine Unilateral, pulsating, moderate-to-severe pain, lasting 4-72hrs, worse with activity and improves with sleep. Associated with nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, \u00b1 aura Abortive: NSAIDs, acetaminophen, triptans, CGRP antagonists Preventative: Anti-depressants, anti-hypertensives, anti-seizures, CGRP antagonists Cluster Severe (often extreme) unilateral peri-orbital/temporal stabbing pain, associated with lacrimation, rhinorrhea, sweating, swelling of face, and visual changes. Occurs in \"clusters\" with each individual episode lasting minutes-to-hours Abortive: 100% FiO2 at 12L/min for at least 15 mins), triptans, indomethacin Preventative: Verapamil Medication Overuse (Rebound) \u226515 days of the month with a pre-existing headache disorder, overusing an abortive treatment, often presents as worsening headache despite increased intake of medication. Using an abortive agent >2-3x/week can cause. Seen with NSAIDs, APAP, caffeine-based medications (Excedrin, Fioricet), triptans, ergotamines, and opioids. Stop offending medication, typically via taper. Headache will worsen before it gets better (important to warn pt of this). Start concurrent daily prophylactic headache medication. Evaluation Assess for red flag symptoms (refer to \"Headache: Inpt\") If no red flag symptoms present, no need for further work-up Assess lifestyle factors that can be contributing to headache: good sleep hygiene, routine meal schedules, regular exercise, water intake, and managing migraine triggers Medication Overview Abortive: - Triptans: Cannot be used more than 10 days/month. Avoid in pts with significant coronary artery disease, prior strokes, and prior MI. Associated with vasospasm. - CGRP antagonists: Newer options. Insurance typically requires failure of 2 abortive triptans prior to approval. Refer to Neurology Clinic for this. Preventative: - Amitriptyline: indicated for both migraine and tension-type. Helps with sleep and comorbid depression. Most common side effects (SE) = dry mouth, sedation - Topiramate: Can help with weight loss. Most common SE = sodas taste bad, sedation/cognitive effects, paresthesias. Avoid in patients with history of kidney stones. - Propranolol: useful for relative lack of interactions. Mild cardiac/blood pressure effects compared to other beta-blockers. Most common SE = drowsiness/insomnia, dizziness - Magnesium oxide: reduces headache frequency with almost no SE. Start 400mg daily, can go up to 800mg BID. Patients can increase their dose as tolerated. Most common SE = diarrhea - Riboflavin (vitamin B2): mild effect but essentially has no side effects. 400mg daily. - Gabapentin: can be useful if HAs have stabbing/electric quality. Main SE = sedation - Venlafaxine: useful for migraines with significant vestibular symptoms (dizziness). SE = hypertension/tachycardia. - Verapamil: can be used for migraine and cluster headaches. Can use ER formulation - Botox: can be administered every 3 months. Can be very effective, but pts generally will have had to fail multiple medications for insurance to approve. Refer to neuro resident clinic - CGRP receptor modulators (mostly injections) such as Rimegepant are newer options MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Background Progressive inflammatory disorder primarily manifesting with demyelination of the central white matter Optic neuritis and transverse myelitis (spinal cord lesion) are common presentations Generally develops over a few days; very uncommon to happen suddenly (e.g. pts will complain about a dark spot appearing in their vision that expands over several days) Evaluation MRI w/wo contrast can identify lesions and determine chronicity \"Active\" MS plaque will contrast enhance and continues to enhance for weeks (even after treatment) Modified MacDonald Criteria: 3 characteristic demyelinating lesions (>1 cm, periventricular, infratentorial (brainstem/cerebellum/cord) or juxtacortical in location) with evidence of separation in time (active and chronic). Positive oligoclonal bands on LP can substitute as dissemination in time. LP with studies for oligoclonal bands, IgG index, cell count and protein, anti-MOG, anti-AQP4 Management Treat flares and optic neuritis with high-dose steroids Speeds up recovery, but does not improve the degree of recovery Often dosing starts with Methylprednisolone IV 1gm x 3-5 days If a pt with known MS has worsening of chronic symptoms, then recrudescence (pseudoflare) is the likely cause \u2192 infectious/toxic/metabolic workup is needed Steroid-sparing agents are the long-term therapy goal but often have significant adverse effects requiring monitoring: Interferon (SQ injections): flu-like symptoms, injection site reactions Glatiramer acetate (SQ): injection site reactions Fingolimod (PO): macular edema, liver injury, increased risk of skin cancer Teriflunomide (PO): liver injury, hair loss, immunosuppression, teratogenic Dimethyl fumarate (PO): GI side effects, lymphocytopenia, liver injury Natalizumab (IV): PML concern, immunosuppression Ocrelizumab (IV): contraindicated in active HBV infection, cannot give live vaccines Alemtuzumab (IV): autoimmune disease, rash, headache Neuromyelitis Optica and Spectrum Disorder Demyelinating disease due to antibodies against aquaporin-4 (on oligodendrocytes) Classically causes optic neuritis and longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis Can be more aggressive than MS Diagnose with NMO antibodies and MS workup as above In the acute setting, exacerbations treated with steroids, but in severe or refractory cases may require PLEX, and disease modifying therapy differs from MS (typically rituximab) NEUROPATHY Author: Nicholas Mallett Background Peripheral neuropathy is damage to peripheral nerves. Classical polyneuropathy is slow, chronic, progressive sensory loss in length-dependent fashion Common etiologies of polyneuropathy: Diabetes, chronic EtOH use, Vitamin Deficiencies/Toxicities, chronic HIV/HBV/HCV, Amyloidosis, Monoclonal Gammopathies, Hypothyroidism, Autoimmune, Medication-related/Iatrogenic, and Critical Illness Mononeuropathy: sensory +/- motor symptoms in a single peripheral nerve distribution (ie carpel tunnel). Can be from local trauma, compression, entrapment Radiculopathy is from spine nerve root localization (ie L4), polyradiculopathy if multiple, plexopathy is process affecting multiple nerves in brachial or lumbosacral plexus Large Fiber Neuropathy: loss of vibration sense/proprioception Small Fiber Neuropathy: loss of pain/temperature sensation \u2013 cannot be dx by EMG/NCS Evaluation Usually diagnosed clinically based on examination and history Polyneuropathy presents with slow, progressive sensory loss in the classic \"stocking and glove\" distribution, usually beginning in the lower extremities. Many patients don't realize numbness until very symptomatic (can't feel car pedals, burning pain, gait disturbances, etc). Can have +Romberg, falls in dark due to poor proprioception Reduced reflexes on examination In cases where exam is not sufficient, EMG/NCS can aid in diagnosis Important to determine etiology behind neuropathy to determine if able to stop/slow progression Basic lab work: A1c, B12 (<400 can cause symptoms), SPEP+FLC and Immunofixation Management No treatment to reverse numbness, aim to treat pain if needed Address underlying etiology to prevent progression If rapidly progressive, consider referral to Neurology for evaluation Neuropathic pain management: - Gabapentin/Pregabalin \u2013 PROS: antiseizure benefits, headache treatment; CONS: dizziness, drowsiness - Duloxetine \u2013 PROS: anxiety/depression effect, migraine prophylaxis; CONS: risk of Serotonin Syndrome/Mania - Amitriptyline \u2013 PROS: depression treatment, headache prophylaxis; CONS: anticholinergic effects - Alpha Lipoic Acid \u2013 relatively benign OTC supplement with antioxidant properties shown to reduce nerve hypoxia with diabetic neuropathy - Topicals: Lidocaine, Capsaicin - Would avoid prescribing opioids for neuropathic pain as they have little benefit PARKINSON'S DISEASE Presentation Resting tremor is typically a very early symptom, often worse on one side Cogwheel rigidity: can be confused for paratonia (seen in demented or encephalopathic pts who have involuntary variable resistance during passive ROM) Speech changes (hypophonia), hand-writing changes (micrographia), bradykinesia Gait changes: Festination: slow start with movements that gradually build up speed En bloc turning: taking multiple steps to turn around Anosmia and REM behavior sleep disorders are very common Evaluation Clinical diagnosis; there are some supportive imaging studies like DaTscan that looks for activity of substantia nigra (usually not necessary) Clinical response to dopamine replacement is so typical that if a pt does not respond, it is important to consider a Parkinson's Disease mimicker. Management Continue home Parkinson's medications the way they take at home. Abrupt discontinuation can cause severe withdrawal. Dopamine replacement: Carbidopa/levodopa; dosed at regular intervals several times a day. Should not be held during admission. If patients are required to be N.P.O. for more than 1-2 days please page neurology for guidance to avoid dopamine withdrawal If pt is altered, can hold anticholinergics, MAO-B inhibitors, or COMT inhibitors Dopamine agonists: can cause confusion, hallucinations, dyskinesias MAO-B inhibitors (MAOIs): can cause confusion, hallucinations, insomnia and dyskinesias COMT inhibitors: can cause confusion, hallucinations, insomnia, and dyskinesias Anticholinergics: useful for tremor when there is not much bradykinesia or gait disturbances. In older pts, cognitive changes are a bigger concern along with hallucinations Parkinson's Disease medications are rarely titrated in the hospital because acute medical illness worsens Parkinsonian symptoms. Medications can be re-adjusted outpatient Be cautious with PRN anti-emetics in pts with PD. Many work via dopamine antagonism. Zofran is generally the safest option Similarly, many antipsychotics have dopamine antagonism. Safest option is quetiapine. Parkinson-Plus Syndromes Evaluation: - Consider if atypical features such as bilateral symmetric onset, early cognitive/personality changes, cerebellar findings, or prominent autonomic dysfunction/falls early Types: Progressive supranuclear palsy PD symptoms with early falls and minimal tremor Vertical eye movement abnormalities Multisystem atrophy Profound orthostatic hypotension without any increase in HR Three types: MSA-A: prominent autonomic features MSA-P: prominent atypical Parkinsonism features MSA-C: prominent cerebellar dysfunction Lewy body dementia Parkinsonism with prominent early cognitive impairment and hallucinations Corticobasal degeneration Alien limb phenomenon (pt feels like affected limb doesn't belong to them) Associated with apraxia and aphasia SEIZURE WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS Background Risk factors: birth trauma, perinatal ischemia, prematurity, TBI with loss of awareness > 1 hour or penetrating wound, strokes, brain masses (tumors, abscesses), prior CNS infections, and recent brain surgery Key for seizures: rhythmic, stereotyped event with sudden onset/offset If bilateral seizure-like activity (eg tonic-clonic), then there will also be loss of awareness If focal, can have loss of awareness or retained awareness Evaluation A clear description or recording of seizure semiology is helpful, including preceding aura, event description, duration, loss of awareness, post-ictal confusion with duration, tongue biting (and location), urination/defecation, frequency of events, and triggers Provoked seizures can develop with new medications (lower threshold), ASM/benzodiazepine/EtOH withdrawal, physical/mental/emotional stressors, hypo/hyperglycemia, significant electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. hyponatremia), CNS infections In pts with new seizures, important to work-up potential underlying etiology If patient has a known seizure disorder with a reversible underlying trigger or typical frequency of seizures and has returned to their baseline neurologic exam, EEG may not be necessary In patients with new first-time seizures who have returned to baseline, would be reasonable to perform EEG in the outpatient setting if there is not a clear reason that the patient would be at risk for a repeat seizure (eg alcohol withdrawal). MRI brain with and without contrast (can be done with epilepsy protocol) once stable Management You do not need to acutely treat a seizure with medication unless there is concern for status epilepticus (generalized tonic clonic activity lasting 5 minutes or greater) Anti-Seizure Medications (ASMs) - Adverse Effects/Side Effects ASMAED Adverse Effects Levetiracetam (Keppra) (PO/IV) Sedation and agitation, worsening of underlying mood disorders. Can trial B6 supplementation to help with mood effects Valproic acid (Depakote) (PO/IV) Sedation, hirsutism, PCOS, P450 inhibitor, nausea, liver injury, hyperammonemia, teratogenicity Phenytoin (Dilantin) (PO)/ Fosphenytoin (IV) Sedation, gingival hyperplasia, arrhythmias Lacosamide (Vimpat) (PO/IV) Heart block, dizziness, ataxia Topiramate (Topamax) (PO) Kidney stones, metabolic acidosis, paresthesias, weight loss, cognitive slowing Carbamazepine (Tegretol) (PO) Hyponatremia, SJS (in Han Chinese check HLA), bone marrow suppression (rare) Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal) (PO) Similar to Carbamazepine Lamotrigine (Lamictal) (PO) SJS/TEN, nausea, least sedating Zonisamide (Zonegran) (PO) Sedation, ataxia, nausea, confusion Non-Epileptic Spells (NES) Can be very difficult to distinguish from epileptic seizures Not all NES are psychogenic, such as myoclonus, tremors, and syncope Features more common in PNES: - Retained awareness with bilateral extremity \"seizing\" - Opisthotonus (arching the back) - Talking during a spell - Excessively long spells (e.g. lasts hour or days) - Forced eye closure - Truncal thrusting - Suppressibility to touch - Coachability during a spell or reacting to external stimuli - Heavy breathing during a spell with lots of rigorous movement - Immediately returning to baseline after a spell Features more common in epileptic seizures: - Seizures arising out of sleep - Highly stereotyped - Incontinence - Severe injuries (e.g. burns) Management: - Try to avoid excessive BZD use that could compromise airway protection - This requires good clinical judgement as you wouldn't want to withhold Ativan and discover that the pt was having true atypical seizures. The compromise would be do not repeatedly administer BZDs when there is suspicion for PNES as well as no evidence of response to prior BZD administration. Syncopal Convulsions Very common, can present with posturing and tonic-clonic movements happening for a few moments after syncope Should not last for more than 30 seconds These are just related to syncope and do not typically require seizure medications Can be associated with urinary incontinence Workup: - Two-hour EEG and MRI (with and without contrast) - Infectious workup, BMP, CBC, blood glucose, toxicology/drug screen - If there is concern for convulsive syncope, (carefully) check orthostatic vitals VERTIGO Background Sensation of the room (or themselves) spinning or moving Must distinguish from lightheadedness, presyncope, orthostasis, and disequilibrium (unsteady on feet) via history Distinguishing between central vs peripheral pattern is useful for workup and management Central pattern: continuous symptoms independent of position and may have other FND Peripheral pattern: positional, no other FND Causes best differentiated based on chronicity and triggers rather than description of symptoms Etiologies BPPV: loose otoliths; short duration (<1min), very positional, nystagmus is horizontal and torsional, towards affected ear with posterior canal being most commonly involved; treat with otolith repositioning maneuvers Vestibular neuritis/labyrinthitis: typically follows URI or ear infection with unidirectional nystagmus away from affected ear; self-limited, but if severe/prolonged can treat with steroids Meniere's disease: Vertigo, tinnitus, and low range frequency hearing loss. Gradually progressive. Treated with diuretics, salt restriction, Meclizine, and sometimes surgery or intratympanic injections Endolymphatic leak: Usually following trauma or concussive blasts. Requires ENT evaluation and management. Classically a loud sound will cause vertigo and nystagmus Vestibular migraine: episodic vertigo associated with headaches; usual migraine triggers, may have aura; often positive family history of migraine Stroke: Typically due to posterior circulation infarct; sudden onset; rare cause of isolated vertigo; ask about vascular risk factors. Also consider vertebral dissection or vertebrobasilar insufficiency Drug-induced: assess recent changes in medications; includes codeine, aminoglycosides, macrolides, sulfamethoxazole, NSAIDs, prednisone, anti-malarials, diuretics, beta-blockers, alpha-antagonists, lithium, antipsychotics Other causes: demyelinating disease (MS), epileptic vertigo (focal seizures), Ramsay-Hunt syndrome (Herpes zoster oticus), cerebellopontine angle tumors (often little vertigo as CNS compensates as tumor slowly grows) Evaluation and Management HINTS Battery \u2013 Head Impulse test, Nystagmus pattern, Test of Skew - Only useful if pt is currently symptomatic - Central pattern: no corrective saccade, multidirectional nystagmus, skew present - Peripheral pattern: corrective saccade, unidirectional nystagmus, no skew present Other tests: - Dix-Hallpike Test - Cerebellar testing: Finger nose finger (FNF), heel knee shin (HKS), gait - Outpt Vestibular function testing with ENT Management: - Central patterns will need head and vessel imaging looking for vertebral dissection or basilar clots - Often, central vertigo is due to centrally acting medications - Peripheral causes are varied and often require evaluation by ENT as an outpt - Treatment with anticholinergics like meclizine or scopolamine is often helpful; antiemetics if significant nausea; and benzodiazepines for refractory acute attacks - Vestibular therapy is also beneficial NEUROLOGIC EMERGENCIES ELEVATED INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE (ICP) AND HYDROCEPHALUS Author: Madelaine Behrens Background Communicating/non-obstructive hydrocephalus: - Causes: subarachnoid granule scarring after subarachnoid hemorrhage or meningitis (Cryptococcal), ependymoma producing excess CSF, venous sinus thrombosis - Safe to perform lumbar puncture Non-communicating/Obstructive Hydrocephalus: - Causes: tumor, abscess, or hematoma in the midline ventricular structures - Avoid lumbar punctures due to risk of herniation Eventually, elevated ICP can cause brain herniation Presentation Headache (can be positional), blurred vision, visual field reduction, enlarged blind spot, nausea, vomiting, encephalopathy, coma Sixth nerve palsies are common (inability for eye to abduct) Third nerve palsies (blown pupil) are classically associated with uncal herniation Evaluation Visual exam: visual fields, enlarged blind spot, papilledema (may not be present if very rapid ICP increase, even with vision loss), and CN6 nerve palsies STAT head CT to look for midline shift, obstructions, and mass lesions Consider Neurosurgery evaluation if obstructive lesion or concern for herniation (craniectomy vs resection vs evacuation vs ventricular drain) CTV or MRV w/wo to look for venous sinus thrombosis (especially in pregnant pts) Venous sinus thrombosis needs anticoagulation, even if there is some degree of hemorrhagic infarction If no obstructive lesion, obtain lumbar puncture with opening pressure (elevated OP > 20mmHg) If workup is otherwise normal, except for elevated opening pressure, this is suggestive of idiopathic intracranial hypertension Management Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: - Acetazolamide and/or topiramate - Ophthalmology evaluation emergently for consideration of nerve sheath fenestrations or urgent ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement if severe disc edema If there is clinical concern for herniation: - Cushing Triad: vital sign changes in herniation, widened pulse pressure (increasing systolic, decreasing diastolic), bradycardia, and irregular respirations - Mannitol: 50g IV, can be given peripherally. Has risks of renal injury. Associated with initial increase in ICP, often given with furosemide to counter this. - Hypertonic saline: 3%, 7% or 23% saline can be given, needs central access for repeat administration but initial dose can be given via peripheral IV. Maintain sodium goal 150-155 for duration of hypertonic goal. - Maintain head of bed at least 30\u00b0 and loosen neck obstructions (c-collars) as able - Consider neurosurgery consult for shunt/external ventricular drain consideration - Hyperventilation can be done with goal PaCO2 30-34 mmHg or ETCO2 20-30 mmHg but is only a temporizing measure and risks rebound edema - After 4-6h, compensatory pH changes in the blood prevent vasoconstrictive affects GUILLAIN-BARRE SYNDROME (GBS) Background Rapid-onset polyneuropathy that manifests most often with ascending weakness and numbness that can involve the respiratory and facial musculature Usually preceded by infectious illness a few weeks prior (Campylobacter, CMV, Flu, HIV, etc) Pts are much more likely to get GBS from an infection than any vaccine, weak vaccine links to GBS are an additional 1-2 cases per million flu vaccines Presentation Most common form is acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) Progressive extremity weakness, weak or absent reflexes, and potentially subjective sensatory changes, especially back pain, with nadir being reached within 4 weeks Sensory loss is common in an ascending pattern too There are many variants of GBS: Miller-Fischer Syndrome: ophthalmoplegia, ataxia Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis: encephalopathy, ophthalmoplegia, ataxia Pure Sensory GBS: sensory loss with only mild motor involvement Do not use lack of classic ascending weakness to dismiss the idea of GBS Evaluation LP: albuminocytologic dissociation = high protein with normal cell count One exception is HIV, which can cause AIDP but also have a high cell count and high protein count EMG/NCV: usually normal early in course, so typically performed at least 2 weeks after symptom onset MRI L-Spine w/wo: Assess for spinal cord lesions, can demonstrate nerve root enhancement Ddx: Spinal cord lesions, LEMS, MG, acute HIV or HCV, viral myelitis (enterovirus/WNV) Management ABCs! Ensure adequate respiratory status with baseline NIF/VC, then Q4-6H NIF > -30 with good effort, generally warrants ICU monitoring IVIG or PLEX Avoid steroids as they can worsen symptoms MYASTHENIA GRAVIS (MG) AND LAMBERT-EATON MYASTHENIC SYNDROME (LEMS) Background Disorders of the neuromuscular junction MG affects the post-synaptic cleft at the acetylcholine receptor (fatigability worsens with use) LEMS affects the pre-synaptic cleft at the calcium channels (fatigability improves with use) Many cases are paraneoplastic (classically small cell lung carcinoma) Presentation Double vision, ptosis, dysarthria, dysphagia Dyspnea looks different than in other conditions: air hunger, usually also with dysphagia Initially, the pt may not look sick or distressed, but may have a short inspiratory time or difficulty speaking in complete sentences due to shallow breathing Most pts have a known history of myasthenia, but up to 20% present initially with crisis Evaluation Physical exam: - Look closely for ptosis, nasal speech, weak neck flexion/extension (same nerve roots as diaphragm), interrupted speech to take extra breaths, diplopia or ptosis with sustained upward gaze - These pts do not exhibit \"huffing and puffing\" like in COPD/asthma exacerbations - Pts with NMJ disease can go from talking to intubated within several hours! - LEMS: less ocular weakness but does have extremity weakness and absent reflexes that improve with muscle use (facilitation) - Pulmonary compromise is very rare in LEMS EMG/NCS: - MG: decremental response to repetitive stimulation - LEMS: increased amplitude in response to repetitive stimulation Labs: myasthenia antibody panels (send prior to IVIG/PLEX being given) Imaging: consider chest CT to look for thymic hyperplasia Management Monitor NIF (negative inspiratory force) at baseline and Q4H-Q8H Measure of diaphragmatic strength (more negative = more force) Normal is more negative than -60 If more positive than -30, consider elective intubation Note that pt effort will affect NIF values IVIG or PLEX: - Both have similar supportive evidence; IVIG is usually easier to do - PLEX has the risks you would expect with dialysis (e.g. fluid shifts) and coagulopathy - IVIG \u2192 check IgA levels. Can increase risk of DVT, has risk of aseptic meningitis and provides significant fluid load so not ideal for pts with CHF Steroids: - Usually up-titrated SLOWLY (by 10-20mg Prednisone daily) - Rapid increases in steroids can worsen pts with MG, so talk to Neurology before adjusting Pyridostigmine: - Typically continue at their home dose - Too much pyridostigmine can make pts worse (more secretions), so for those doing poorly on >90mg per dose, consider lowering the dose Treat underlying causes of exacerbations\u2014usually infections or other toxic/metabolic insults Remove/avoid exacerbating medications: Fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, beta blockers, Mg. There are many medications to avoid. Please refer to UpToDate for more thorough list. LEMS specific management: - 3,4-Diaminopyridine - Can respond to IVIG or Pyridostigmine - Workup for underlying neoplasm STATUS EPILEPTICUS Background Either a single seizure >5 minutes or 2 seizures without a return to baseline in between Differentiating convulsive seizures from non-epileptic events (\"pseudoseizure\"): See \"Seizure without Status Epilepticus\" chapter Features that suggest non-epileptic/psychogenic event include moaning or talking throughout the event, \"no-no\" head shake, repetitive movements of opposing muscle groups, very arrhythmic or purposeful-looking movements, or seizures that have been ongoing for \"hours\" Evaluation Fingerstick glucose, BMP/CBC, and UDS Consult Neurology EEG (start with 2hr) to determine if it is seizure or not and for titration of medications Consider a non-contrasted head CT. MRI cannot be obtained while EEG is attached Up to half of pts presenting in status epilepticus have no history of seizure, so they need urgent head imaging, consideration for lumbar puncture, infectious and toxic workup, tox screen, and sometimes rheumatologic or paraneoplastic workup If history of seizure or on antiseizure medications (ASMs) obtain trough levels Management ABCs! Start with benzos: - 2 mg lorazepam IV then repeat q1-3 minutes up to 0.1 mg/kg OR - 5 mg of diazepam IV every minute (takes longer to give diazepam so would give concurrent ASM) OR - 10 mg IM midazolam if no IV access After 2 rounds of benzos, shift to anti-seizure medications if still in status (neurology should be contacted here if not already): - IV fosphenytoin 20 mg/kg - IV valproic acid 40 mg/kg - IV levetiracetam 60 mg/kg (up to 4.5g max) If still seizing at this point, the pt will likely need intubation: - These pts MUST be placed on EEG if they get paralyzed or sedated because convulsive status often continues as nonconvulsive status, which still damages the brain. - If still seizing, pts should be on midazolam, Propofol, or barbiturate infusions - Focal seizures, such as arm or face twitching with retained awareness do not always need to be treated to the point of initiating coma STROKE Background Sudden onset, focal (usually unilateral) neurologic deficits: Weakness, sensory loss, vision loss, ataxia/unsteadiness, vertigo, double vision, facial droop, dysarthria, aphasia Differential: - Stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) - Seizure or post-ictal paralysis - Headache phenomena (complex migraine) - Spinal cord lesions, though these more commonly cause bilateral symptoms - Stroke-like symptoms can also develop as recrudescence\u2013previous stroke or brain lesion symptoms worsening with systemic toxic, metabolic, infectious processes or hypotension Evaluation Critical decision-making information: Last time pt was at their neurologic baseline (last known normal - LKN), time symptoms first observed, anticoagulation status, recent surgeries, history of bleeding (severe GIB or ICH), recent medications, blood pressure, blood sugar, platelet count, and baseline neuro exam If LKN within 24 hours and patient having persistent symptoms, then call a Stroke Alert! - Purpose of Stroke Alert is to work pt up for acute treatment (thrombolytics and thrombectomy). - VUMC: Call 11111 and tell the operator stroke alert and current pt location. It is helpful to call down to the CT techs to determine what scanner the patient will be going to and order a stat CT perfusion (CT head noncontrast and CTA head/neck also included in this order set in Epic). - NAVA: Dial 911 from a VA landline and tell them you want to call a Stroke Alert. Use Stroke Orderset and order a CTH/CTA H/N. Consult and STAT page Neurology residents at 835-5137. Call National Tele-Stroke Provider (469-627-4790), who will run the alert with Neurology residents assisting if possible. STAT CT Head/CTA/CTP for consideration of TNK or endovascular therapy - If renal function is abnormal, discuss with neurology - MRI/MRA is an option but takes longer (MRAs are also better with Gadolinium) - Neurology service should be leading this portion Management Blood pressure goals: Ischemic Stroke: - In general, aim is for permissive hypertension during the first 24 hours (allow SBP up to 220 if patient did not receive TNK) when in the acute phase, avoiding antihypertensives and hypotension - Pts with high-grade stenosis, intracranial atherosclerosis may require higher BP to maintain perfusion Hemorrhagic Stroke: - In general, SBP goal <140, range 130-150 but no need to press if running less Q1H neuro checks Ischemic stroke: - EKG/telemetry - TTE with Contrast to assess for intracardiac thrombus/PFO - A1c with goal <7.0% - LDL with goal <70 Hemorrhagic stroke: - Reverse coagulopathies - Repeat head imaging typically 6 hours after initial scan to monitor for stability of bleed - Typically avoid antiplatelets and anticoagulation - Obtain MRI brain with and without contrast to evaluate for underlying etiology See physical handbook for VUMC stroke alert activation flowchart Note: Neuro alert is no longer in effect.

Bear in mind that there are always exceptions Many ocular problems are not urgent and can be dealt with outpt. Assessing the acuity of onset is the first step The top differential for blurry vision is dry eye, cataract, or uncorrected refractive error If the symptoms are acute and just in one eye, it is more likely to be ocular and warrants further investigation (likely ophthalmology consult) Clinical Algorithm: Duration of current symptoms: - >2 weeks: Consider referral to outpatient Ophthalmology clinic upon discharge. If concerned for urgent process, page Ophthalmology to ask if an inpatient consult is appropriate. <2 weeks: \"Double vision\" or \"Floaters/Spots\" \u2192 See appropriate flowchart Clarify what patient means by \"blurry vision\": - \"Out of focus\" or \"fuzzy\" (i.e., actually blurry vision) Blurry in one or both eyes?

Consider ophthalmology consult APPROACH TO DOUBLE VISION (DIPLOPIA) Key Points: This flowchart is meant to serve as a guide. Bear in mind that there are always exceptions Most important question to ask with any pt complaining of double vision is whether it goes away when covering one eye. If it does, then it is an ocular misalignment issue (= true binocular diplopia) If the diplopia is acute and constant, this requires more urgent evaluation than if intermittent. Look at the pupil and eye movements: If the eye is dilated (\"blown pupil\"), abducted and infraducted (\"down and out position\"), and ptotic, this is classic for a complete CN3 palsy and requires immediate neuroimaging (e.g. CTA head) to rule out an enlarging aneurysm Clinical Algorithm: Does the double vision go away when you cover either eye? No: This is monocular diplopia which is not an ocular misalignment issue. Differential includes: Dry eye Cataract Refractive error (e.g. astigmatism) Other corneal surface abnormality Macular degeneration Can try Refresh artificial tears 4-6x a day to see if ameliorates symptoms Yes (=true binocular diplopia): Intermittent or constant?

A pt may say they see a visual disturbance in the left eye, when in reality it is in the left visual field of both eyes (indicating that it is a neurological issue, e.g., migraine). Ask if the pt has tried closing one eye to see if the visual phenomenon is actually in one eye. Rapid onset of floaters, often preceded by a peripheral crescent-shaped light flash, is classic for posterior vitreous detachment. A black curtain or veil that comes down in the vision is classic for retinal detachment Clinical Algorithm: Duration of current symptoms: - >2 weeks: Consider referral to outpatient Ophthalmology upon discharge. If concerned for urgent process, page Ophthalmology to ask if inpatient consultation is appropriate <2 weeks: Scintillating or colorful light spots? Yes: This is most likely a neurologic (e.g. migraines) and or psychiatric (e.g. anxiety) diagnosis. Scintillating colorful spots are likely migraines It would be exceedingly rare for a retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, etc. to occur in both eyes simultaneously Page ophthalmology if concerns No: Symptoms in one or both eyes? Both eyes: Systemic infection/malignancy with concern for bilateral intraocular involvement? Yes: Consider Ophthalmology consult No: (Same as above - likely neurologic/psychiatric) One eye: Light flashes in periphery or crescent-shaped? Yes: Consider Ophthalmology consult No: Floaters constant or intermittent? Constant: Consider Ophthalmology consult APPROACH TO A RED EYE When the conjunctiva is vasodilated, or \"injected,\" the eye looks red. The more inflamed the conjunctiva, the angrier-looking the eye Differential: Dry Eye: - Trace diffuse injection, blurry vision that fluctuates, gritty sensation, clears with blinking Corneal abrasion, ulceration, or exposure keratopathy: - Unilateral, moderate to severe injection, may be diffuse or sectoral, pain, blurry vision, mucus discharge, history of poor blink rate, intubated/sedated status. Subconjunctival hemorrhage: - Patch of bright red, often with sharp borders. Due to rupture of conjunctival vessel. Whole conjunctiva can be involved and may be bright red. Looks scarier than it is. Common in pts on anticoagulation or after a Valsalva maneuvers. Will resolve spontaneously Allergic conjunctivitis: - Chemosis, mild to moderate injection, blurry vision, very itchy, watery discharge, hx of allergies/atopy Viral or bacterial conjunctivitis: - Moderate to severe injection, scattered subconjunctival hemorrhages or petechiae, itchy or burning/painful eyes. If viral, look for preauricular adenopathy or recent URI Acute angle closure glaucoma: - Severe eye pain with nausea/vomiting, rock-hard eye, mid-dilated and fixed pupil, blurry vision Uveitis, episcleritis, scleritis: - Eye pain, perilimbal injection (\"ciliary flush\"), blurry vision, may have history of autoimmune disease. Episcleritis vs scleritis can be difficult to discern. Scleritis may have a deeper, violaceous hue Endophthalmitis: - Eye pain, history of trauma or eye surgery, severe vision loss, history of immunocompromise and systemic infection (if endogenous) Carotid-cavernous fistula: - Engorged and tortuous conjunctival vessels, recent history of trauma, resistance to retropulsion (pushing the globe back in) ANISOCORIA Background Anisocoria: unequal pupil size Physiological anisocoria: Pupil sizes differ by <1mm. Constriction of the pupil is driven by parasympathetic innervation; dilation by sympathetic innervation Conditions that can cause anisocoria: Benign episodic mydriasis: - Intermittent episodes of pupillary dilation and possible association with migraine. No other significant neurologic or ocular symptoms present. Important to exclude other causes of mydriasis prior to this diagnosis Horner's syndrome: - Pupillary miosis + ipsilateral upper lid ptosis - May be congenital or acquired - Acquired causes include trauma involving sympathetic pathway, carotid dissection, cavernous sinus pathology, stroke, neck or thoracic surgery, or Pancoast / mediastinal tumor (rare). - If suspect new onset Horner's, consider Neurology and Ophthalmology consult. CN3 Palsy: - Pupillary mydriasis (\"blown pupil\") + adduction, supraduction, infraduction deficit, \"down and out position\", upper lid ptosis. Must rule out a compressive lesion on CN3 - If new onset, consider head imaging and Neurology and Ophthalmology consult Medications (especially anticholinergics): - Commonly seen in young pts with scopolamine patches who forget to wash hands after handling the patch; dilation can last one day to a couple weeks Trauma: - Damage to the iris sphincter after eye trauma can cause a dilated pupil that is poorly reactive to light Eye surgery: - Pts who have undergone intraocular surgery (like cataract surgery) may have an irregularly shaped, less reactive, and slightly dilated pupil as compared to the other eye due to damage or stretching of the iris during the operation Infections: - Viral infections and syphilis can cause parasympathetic denervation, resulting in a relatively mydriatic pupil that is poorly reactive to light. However, the accommodative pupillary response (i.e., constriction at focusing on an object at near) may be intact - \"Adie's Tonic Pupil\": Idiopathic cause of parasympathetic denervation presenting similarly as above. Viruses (HSV) are sometimes thought to be behind idiopathic cases. Acute angle closure glaucoma: - During an acute attack, the pupil may be mid-dilated and sluggish to light. However, pts will also have symptoms of acute angle closure (e.g. headaches, nausea/vomiting, eye pain, etc. See Glaucoma section for more info) CONJUNCTIVITIS Background and Presentation Allergic, viral, or bacterial cause All forms present with red and irritated conjunctiva In practice it can be difficult to distinguish between the types of conjunctivitis. Allergic: Hx of allergies/atopy, bilateral, chemosis, watery/mucoid discharge, itchiness predominant symptom Viral: Hx of recent URI or exposure, unilateral first then bilateral, itchy/burning, subconjunctival hemorrhages or petechiae, watery/mucoid discharge, tender preauricular lymph nodes Bacterial: Itching less prominent. Burning, aching, and stabbing discomfort predominates. Unilateral first then bilateral. Mucoid/purulent discharge (and more copious) Blurry vision is common, but loss of vision should not occur if disease limited to conjunctiva Management: Allergic: eliminate allergen, artificial tears, antihistamine/mast-cell stabilizer drops (olopatadine, ketotifen), oral antihistamine (diphenhydramine, loratadine) Viral: 4-8x/day artificial tears, cold compresses, isolation precautions Bacterial: culture/swab the ocular discharge, isolation precautions, moxifloxacin drops (Vigamox) QID or trimethoprim/polymyxin B drops/ointment for 5-7 days Consult Ophthalmology if concern for worsening CATARACTS Background Opacification of the eye's natural lens Primary cause is normal aging, occurs bilaterally and symmetrically Other causes include congenital, trauma, and meds (esp chronic / long-term steroid use) Presentation Most common symptoms include progressive decreased vision over years, increased glare, increased difficulty with night vision Evaluation and Management Unless the cataracts are dense enough, it is difficult to appreciate without a slit lamp exam Place an outpt ophthalmology referral CORNEAL ABRASION, EXPOSURE KERATOPATHY, ULCERATION Background Corneal abrasion = corneal epithelial defect (KED): An area of missing corneal epithelium. This is akin to a scratch on the skin. Most common causes include trauma, excessive surface dryness, infection, and neurotrophic disease Exposure keratopathy: Development of corneal epithelial defects secondary to incomplete closure of the eyelids (e.g. prolonged exposure of the cornea to air). Most often occurs in pts who are intubated/sedated, have poor orbicularis tone/paralysis (Bell palsy), or have abnormal blink rate (e.g. Parkinson's) Corneal ulceration: The injury extends past the corneal epithelium and 'ulcerates' into the underlying stroma. Ulcerations are often infectious and develop after untreated abrasions (abrasions are essentially open wounds). In rare cases ulcerations can also be sterile (autoimmune/inflammatory). Presentation and Evaluation Abrasions and ulcerations are often extremely painful. May be exacerbated by blinking Conjunctival injection; but sometimes the eye can appear normal, or only have trace redness, and the pain may seem out of proportion to external appearance Mucus discharge and crusting Photophobia and tearing Blurry vision Ulcerations will present with the above, but also have a whitish infiltrate in the cornea. The conjunctival injection and discharge will often be a lot worse 1 drop of Proparacaine 0.5% will improve pain Note: Proparacaine is used only for diagnostic, and not therapeutic, purposes. Do not administer proparacaine on a scheduled or PRN basis for pain. The duration of action is only 15 minutes, and repeated chronic use can lead to corneal melt/ulceration 1 drop of fluorescein followed by shining a blue light (or Wood's lamp) will reveal the KED Management VUMC Perioperative Corneal Abrasion Protocol: - If pt is recently postop or underwent recent extubation and presents with eye pain/burning, blurry vision, redness, photophobia, VUMC has a periop corneal abrasion protocol (does not require ophthalmology consult) - Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment TID into the lower fornix of eye x5 days - If the pain and redness do not improve within 48 hours, then consult ophthalmology Corneal abrasion: - Can try erythromycin ophthalmic ointment TID as above - If the pain and redness do not improve within 48 hours, or have other concerns, consult Ophthalmology Exposure keratopathy: - If pt is intubated and sedated, or cannot otherwise fully close his/her eyes, take the following measures to prevent development of corneal abrasion or ulceration: - Moisture chambers (aka bubble shields) to eyes at all times - Copious amount of lubricating ophthalmic ointment (e.g., Lubrifresh) in eyes TID Corneal ulceration: - If you see whitish material in the cornea itself, this is likely a corneal ulceration and warrants an Ophthalmology consult DRY EYE Background Most common ocular complaint, especially amongst pts admitted to the hospital Due to insufficient tear production and/or imbalance of components that make up tear film Etiology is vast and can include aging, eye strain/overuse, contact lens use, systemic and topical medications, post eye surgery, nutritional deficiencies, autoimmune disease, or concomitant with other ocular conditions Presentation Blurry vision bilaterally that comes and goes (very common\u2013if the pt complains of fluctuating blurriness, dry eye should be at the top of your differential) Excessive tearing or watery eyes Stinging, burning, soreness, discomfort, gritty, or foreign body sensation Discomfort with eye movements Trace/mild conjunctival injection Evaluation and Management Schedule preservative-free (PF) artificial tears at least 4x/day and lubricating eye ointment at bedtime to see if the pt's symptoms improve. Polyvinyl alcohol-povidone PF (Refresh Classic) Lubricating ophthalmic ointment (Lubrifresh) Do not order PRN. Pts will not ask. If a pt's symptoms fail to improve or worsen on artificial tears, consider paging ophthalmology for additional assistance. If there is no apparent imminent threat to vision, you can place an ophthalmology outpt referral upon discharge FUNGEMIA AND INTRAOCULAR INVOLVEMENT The American Academy of Ophthalmology currently does NOT recommend routine Ophthalmology consults for visually asymptomatic pts with systemic candidemia. The incidence of candidemia-related endophthalmitis detected from routine screenings is <1% By contrast, if the pt has visual symptoms, an Ophthalmology consult is warranted. Reference: - Breazzano MP et al. American Academy of Ophthalmology Recommendations on Screening for Endogenous Candida Endophthalmitis. Ophthalmology. 2022 Jan;129(1):73-76 GLAUCOMA Background Glaucoma is a disease of the optic nerve that follows a characteristic pattern of optic nerve fiber degeneration High intraocular pressure (IOP) is believed to be the main etiology of the disease While the \"normal\" IOP range is between 11 and 21 mmHg, there are individuals who have a pressure above 21 that do not develop glaucoma. Conversely, there are individuals who have a pressure in the normal range that DO develop glaucoma (= Normal Tension Glaucoma) Aqueous humor fills the anterior chamber and drains through a sieve-like structure called the trabecular meshwork (TM), located in the angle between the iris and the cornea. After passing through TM, aqueous drains into the eye's venous system. Impediment to aqueous flow will cause elevated IOP Presentation All glaucomas generally cause progressive peripheral visual field loss that ultimately encroaches on central fixation and leads to irreversible blindness if left untreated A glaucomatous optic nerve is often described as \"cupped\" Presents in an acute or chronic fashion Acute angle-closure glaucoma: - The iridocorneal angle rapidly closes, blocking aqueous drainage and causing a sudden rise in IOP (usually >40 mmHg) - Signs and symptoms: Intense eye or orbital pain, headache, nausea/vomiting, blurred vision, halos around lights, fixed and mid-dilated pupil, rock-hard eye, conjunctival redness, cloudy cornea - Usually unilateral, but occasionally can be bilateral - Classic trigger is a pupil-dilating factor (e.g. dark environment or anticholinergic medications) in a person with anatomically narrow angles - If IOP is not lowered within hours, permanent optic nerve damage and vision loss will likely occur Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG): - Most common glaucoma in the US - The iridocorneal angle is open, but due to inadequately functioning TM (or other mechanism) aqueous does not drain properly and IOP is chronically elevated. - Often painless and without noticeable vision changes in the early stage of disease. Individuals can go undiagnosed for years, sitting at an IOP of say 30 mmHg, without being aware they are losing vision until the vision loss is severe Evaluation and Management Primary open angle: - Continue the pt's home glaucoma drops; caution if they develop a medical condition that results in a contraindication (See table below) - Pro tip: Often pts will remember the cap color of drops, but not the names Class Common Examples (Brand Name) Common Examples (Generic Name) Mechanism Side Effects Contraindications Prostaglandin Analogues Xalatan (Teal cap), Travatan (Blue/Teal cap), Lumigan (Blue/Teal cap) Latanoprost, Travoprost, Bimatoprost Increase outflow Conjunctival injection, iris darkening, eyelash growth Uveitis, CME Beta Blockers Timoptic (Yellow cap), Betoptic (Yellow cap) Timolol, Betaxolol Decrease production Bradycardia, bronchospasm, hypotension Asthma, COPD, CHF, Bradycardia, Heart block Alpha Agonists Alphagan (Purple cap) Brimonidine Decrease production and increase outflow Conjunctival injection, dry mouth, fatigue Severe cardiovascular disease, MAOIs Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors Trusopt (Orange cap), Azopt (Orange cap) Dorzolamide, Brinzolamide Decrease production Stinging, blurry vision, taste disturbance Sulfa allergy, Severe renal impairment Combination Drops Cosopt (Blue cap), Combigan (Purple cap) Dorzolamide + Timolol, Brimonidine + Timolol Combined mechanisms Combined side effects Combined contraindications Cosopt (Blue cap) = dorzolamide + timolol Combigan (Purple cap) = brimonidine + timolol Acute Angle Closure: - If concerned for acute angle closure, consult Ophthalmology ASAP - The goal is to lower the IOP ASAP. Target <30 mmHg - Administer frequent rotating rounds of all the IOP-lowering drops: 1 drop of Cosopt (then wait 5 minutes), followed by Brimonidine (then wait 5 minutes), followed by Latanoprost (then wait 5 minutes)--then keep repeating the cycle until the IOP goes down - Concurrently, administer one dose of IV Diamox 500mg if not contraindicated (e.g., renal insufficiency or hepatic cirrhosis). Ophthalmology will recheck the IOP every hour or so to ensure that the IOP is responding (usually it does) - If the IOP does not respond, pt will need a bedside AC tap to offload aqueous and lower the pressure - Pt should ultimately get a Laser Peripheral Iridotomy (LPI) to avoid future angle-closure attacks, which is typically performed as an outpt procedure OPTIC NEURITIS Background Inflammation of the optic nerve often caused by demyelinating disease (e.g. multiple sclerosis). Less often, can be caused by infection (viral etiology, bartonella, Lyme, syphilis, TB, toxoplasmosis) or infiltrative process (e.g., sarcoidosis, malignancy) Presentation Scotoma, constant blurry vision or blurred spot, pain with eye movements, along with other systemic neurologic symptoms (if demyelinating process) If pt is of age 20s-40s and female, autoimmune/demyelinating disease is at top of the differential. If pt is older, consider other causes If pt is immunocompromised, infectious etiology becomes more likely. Evaluation Consult both ophthalmology and neurology if concerned for an optic neuritis MRI brain and orbits with and without contrast, thin slices, fat suppression If no contraindications to imaging, obtain LP with CSF studies (glucose, protein, cell count, Gram stain, bacterial/viral cultures, RPR/VDRL, oligos, consider NMO/AQP4) Management High dose IV methylprednisolone If vision continues to worsen and/or presence of other systemic neurologic symptoms despite steroid treatment, consider escalation to PLEX therapy with assistance of neurology ORBITAL VS PRESEPTAL CELLULITIS Background The septum is a fibrous, membranous structure that divides the anterior and posterior orbit. Preseptal cellulitis: Infection is bound anterior to the septum Orbital cellulitis (AKA postseptal cellulitis): infection extends posterior to the septum Common risk factors/etiologies: URI, acute or chronic sinusitis, trauma, tooth abscess, stye or other local/adjacent skin infection or condition, local or adjacent bug bite, immunocompromised state, underlying systemic infection Often bacterial cause (gram positive Staph or Strep species, and/or gram negative anaerobic species like Peptococcus or Bacteroides). Consider fungal infection (Aspergillus, Mucor) in immunocompromised or diabetic pts Presentation Feature Preseptal Cellulitis Orbital Cellulitis Periorbital edema Yes Yes Periorbital erythema Yes Yes Conjunctival injection Sometimes Yes Chemosis Rare Sometimes Pain with eye movements No Yes Ophthalmoplegia (restricted eye movements) No Yes Proptosis No Yes Vision loss No Sometimes RAPD No Sometimes Fever Sometimes Often Evaluation Vital signs Labs: CBC, CMP, ESR, CRP, blood cultures, wound culture if any open draining areas Imaging: CT orbits with and without contrast Daily or BID photographs to track progression You can use the LRINEC scale to help assess whether the infection is necrotizing: https://www.mdcalc.com/lrinec-score-necrotizing-soft-tissue-infection Management Necrotizing soft tissue infections should be addressed immediately and undergo surgical debridement ASAP Preseptal cellulitis can usually be managed on an outpt basis with PO antibiotics (e.g. augmentin) with close follow-up If condition is worsening, if there is failure to improve on PO antibiotics, or if concerned for postseptal extension (i.e. that the preseptal cellulitis has evolved into an orbital cellulitis), management generally includes: IV broad spectrum antibiotics (usually Unasyn + vancomycin to start if no intracranial extension; could also do vancomycin + ceftriaxone + flagyl) Ophthalmology consult Consider ID consult Consider ENT consult if concomitant sinus disease (most of the time there is) Consider OMFS consult if suspect etiology is odontogenic Tobradex eye drops QID to affected eye Nasal toilet (afrin, flonase, nasal saline)\u2014usually dictated by ENT Warm compresses at least QID to affected eye Trend daily CRP If there is failure to improve, a large orbital abscess, optic nerve stretch on CT scan, evidence of necrotizing infection, or visual compromise, surgical drainage may be necessary. PAPILLEDEMA Background Edema of the optic nerve due to increased intracranial pressure Ophthalmology is often consulted to rule out papilledema in pts who fit the \"Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)\" profile, or with pts with other reasons for high ICP Presentation Symptoms of increased ICP: headaches that vary with position (often worse with bending over), nausea, vomiting, neck stiffness/meningismus, pulsatile tinnitus, fevers/chills Visual symptoms: transient visual obscurations, dimming of vision, blurry vision, loss of color vision/red desaturation, loss of peripheral vision, scotoma Evaluation and Management Consult Ophthalmology and Neurology if concerned for papilledema. Neurosurgery should be involved if there is concern for shunt failure or other neurosurgical problem. Ophthalmology / Neurology will advise on what imaging to order (usually MRI / MRV brain with and without contrast, + MRI Orbits with and without contrast and fat suppression) If no contraindications after imaging, obtain LP with opening pressure, with CSF sent for cells, protein, glucose, and infectious/neoplastic workup where appropriate Ophthalmology / Neurology may recommend PO or IV acetazolamide RETINAL DETACHMENT AND POSTERIOR VITREOUS DETACHMENT Background Retinal detachment (RD): Detachment of retinal tissue from the back of the eye. Risk factors include trauma, high myopia (nearsightedness), older age, history of RD in the other eye, prior eye surgery, and family history Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD): Detachment of vitreous from the retina. PVDs eventually will happen to all adults as the vitreous liquefies and shrivels with age. Some are asymptomatic PVDs can lead to RDs, but not always. As the vitreous peels away from the underlying retina, vitreous can pull a piece of retina with it, causing a retinal tear. The retinal tear, if not treated, can evolve into an RD. Presentation and Evaluation Both can present with acute flashes and floaters However, RDs will often present with a black curtain or veil that comes down somewhere in the pt's field of vision. PVDs may result in blurriness, but will not present with veils, scotomas, or severe loss of vision Management If pt presents with acute flashes, floaters, and/or black curtains in field of vision in one eye, consult ophthalmology If not acute, or if symptoms occur in both eyes simultaneously, chances are this is not a PVD or an RD. See \"Approach to Flashes, Floaters, Spots\" section UVEITIS (includes Iritis, Cyclitis, Retinitis, Choroiditis) Background Uveitis: Inflammation of either or all of these structures. However, \"uveitis\" is a bit of a misnomer, since it is used to denote inflammation of any ocular component Uveitis is usually associated with autoimmune conditions, less commonly with infections Type Anterior Uveitis Intermediate Uveitis Posterior Uveitis Panuveitis Practical synonyms Iritis Pars planitis, Cyclitis Retinitis, Choroiditis, Chorioretinitis Diffuse uveitis Definition Inflammation localized to the anterior segment Inflammation localized to the vitreous cavity and pars plana Inflammation localized to choroid and retina Inflammation involving the anterior, intermediate, and posterior structures Symptoms Vision loss, Usually painful, Perilimbal redness Vision loss, Pain varies Vision loss, Pain varies Vision loss, Pain varies Common etiologies Idiopathic, HLA-B27, IBD, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, Lymphoma, Sarcoid, Syphilis, TB Spillover from anterior uveitis, Multiple sclerosis, Sarcoidosis, Toxoplasmosis, Syphilis, TB Immunocompromised (HIV, transplant), CMV, HSV, VZV, Vasculitis, Lymphoma Behcet's disease, Sarcoid, Syphilis, TB, Toxoplasmosis Management If you suspect a pt has uveitis, consult ophthalmology for evaluation Pts with any of the above associated systemic conditions (e.g., IBD) do not need an inpt Ophthalmology consult unless the pt has visual symptoms. Referral to outpt Ophthalmology is appropriate for routine screening WILSON'S DISEASE: OPHTHALMIC MANIFESTATIONS The two classic ophthalmic manifestations of Wilson's disease are the \"Kayser-Fleischer ring\" (copper deposition around the corneal limbus) and the \"Sunflower cataract\" (copper deposition in the lens) Wilson's disease rarely affects vision (unless the sunflower cataract is very advanced) Unless the disease is very advanced and/or has been present for years, it is impossible for one to detect subtle copper deposition in the cornea, iridocorneal angle, or lens without an office-based slit lamp exam and gonioscopy (only available in the outpt setting) The presence or absence of a Kayser-Fleischer ring does not rule in or rule out the disease Testing for decreased ceruloplasmin, urinary copper levels, and genetic testing are more effective diagnostic methods If concerned about the visual impact of a developing sunflower cataract, an outpt ophthalmology referral is appropriate","title":"Ophthalmology"},{"location":"Ophthalmology/#ophthalmology","text":"Editor and Author: Jonathan A.

It should also be pertinent to a patient's current admission or a recent change in clinical status. Ask: \"Why would this patient code? Is resuscitation a reversible treatment in this case? What are the chances this patient will survive to discharge after CPR? Is the outcome in line with the patient's goals?\" Help the patient make an educated decision based on (1) their goals and (2) the efficacy of resuscitation. Important Points to Keep in Mind for Code Status Discussions A patient must have decisional capacity to decide their code status. If not, engage their surrogate. NEVER say \"Do you want us to do everything?\" Many patients say yes, even if they do not want CPR. It is helpful to give examples of certain situations (i.e., your heart stops or you can't breathe because of a bad pneumonia). After understanding a patient's goals, it is appropriate to make recommendations based on your medical judgment. NOTE: A patient can be DNR but okay for intubation (i.e., no CPR in the case of cardiac arrest; however, if the patient develops respiratory failure, they would want intubation). The opposite (DNI but okay for resuscitation) is NOT an option at VUMC, as we intubate in ACLS. Every new patient to your service (admission or transfer) needs code status updated. For patients you worry may decompensate, consider confirming/readdressing code status. An Approach to Obtaining Code Status Introduction Normalize the conversation: \"These are questions we ask every patient when they come to the hospital. We don't expect this to happen, but it is important for us to understand your wishes in the event you are unable to make your own decisions.\" Determining a Surrogate \"If you couldn't make decisions for yourself, who would you trust to make your decisions? The person you pick should be able to speak to what they think you would want, NOT what they would want for you.\" Intubation (discuss this first to avoid the 'DNI but not DNR situation') \"Everyone has different opinions on what type of medical care they would want if they became sicker. One of the things we discuss are ventilators (breathing machines). We sometimes use these if someone cannot breathe on their own (i.e., pneumonia). Some patients want to trial a breathing machine for a short time to see if they improve. But they would not want to be kept alive on a ventilator. Do you know what you might want?\" If they are not sure, or it seems interventions might be futile (i.e., patient has severe frailty or end-stage disease that makes recovery to extubation unlikely), you can make a recommendation: \"In your case, if you were to need a ventilator, I think this would be reasonable to trial\u2014\" or \"\u2014I worry you might not be able to recover enough to breathe on your own.\" Pause and allow for questions. Remember if they say DNI, they must be DNR because intubation occurs with ACLS. This is not allowed at VUMC. It is technically allowed at the VA if the patient specifically requests it. CPR Prime this with: \"The next question can be hard to think about, but in case of an emergency, it is important to know what you would want. If you had a cardiac arrest, where your heart stops beating and you die, would you want chest compressions to try to restart your heart?\" If a patient seems unsure, you can offer the following: \"Evidence that CPR is not always successful. If you take 10 patients and their hearts stop, meaning they died, and we do CPR as fast as possible, only 3 of them would have their hearts restarted. Only 1 patient would leave the hospital.\" What if you think performing CPR is NOT medically appropriate? It is a patient's decision (attendings can change code status out of medical futility in TN at VUMC, not at the VA). Code status can be revisited, especially if the patient was initially overwhelmed or if their clinical status changes. Consider framing the discussion differently and offer your recommendation: \"While you are in the hospital, we will support you with interventions and medications that we think are helpful based on what you have told us important to you. However, we are worried that some of the interventions you are asking for may cause more harm than good. Many people think that CPR works like it does on TV. Unfortunately, we know that most patients who need CPR in the hospital do not survive like they do on TV. In your case, we do not think it would bring you back to your current state. I worry that this is not something that will be helpful to you and would cause you to suffer.\" Another phrase that is helpful is \"Allow for a natural death.\" When the discussion occurs with surrogates, this leads to higher rates of changing code status than saying DNR. For example, \"I worry that given how sick your [loved one] is, that the additional interventions of CPR if she were to die, would prevent her from having a natural death.\" Navigating Difficult Conversations Author: Mohana Karlekar Navigating difficult conversations with patients can be daunting, especially if you have never seen someone do one well before. Conversations should follow a logical and sequential approach much like any procedure we perform in medicine. Like all procedures, practice makes us better. For difficult conversations that are not emergently required, do not rush. Remember: It may be on your to-do list, and it may feel routine, but many of these discussions are life-altering to patients and families. Before the conversation: Provide yourself ample time to gather information (from specialists, literature, etc.) and to consider your approach to these discussions. During the discussion: Make sure you are in a private area, that a patient has family members they do/do not want present, and you allocate time for questions. Good communicators have both formulated their message and identified which communication strategy to use before they initiate a conversation. Here are some suggestions for \"Navigating Difficult Conversations\" Step 1. Determine your message\u2014keep it simple and short (see Goals of Care section) Step 2. Identify what type of news you are communicating: breaking bad news, assessing understanding of information, communicating prognosis, or navigating goals of care. For references, view VitalTalk\u2122 at: - https://www.vitaltalk.org/resources/quick-guides/ Prognosis Author: Liana Mosley Background Prognosis is estimating the likelihood of an outcome (morbidity, mortality) due to a medical condition and can help guide clinicians, patients, and families in medical decision making. Estimating prognosis should be specific to each patient's situation (i.e., type of cancer, transplant eligibility, comorbidities). Factors to consider include a patient's functional status, laboratory values, and their own reported symptoms. Estimating Prognosis Examples of Factors to Consider Functional status \u2013 ECOG is used in cancer care to reflect a patient's ability to carry out daily activities at home and can predict a patient's ability to tolerate therapy. Systemic Manifestations of Disease \u2013 i.e., cachexia, significant unintentional weight loss, lab values suggestive of inflammation (ex: Modified Glasgow Prognostic Score). Frailty \u2013 a state of diminished physiological reserve and increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes when exposed to a stressor (ex: Clinical Frailty Scale). Comorbidities \u2013 patients with baseline organ dysfunction (COPD, CKD, CHF, dementia) may have a worse prognosis than a patient without comorbidities. Tools While there are disease-specific prognostication tools, ePrognosis is a tool that estimates prognosis in any older patient. It estimates likelihood of mortality based on comorbidities and functional status to aid in medical decision making (https://eprognosis.ucsf.edu/). Errors Studies suggest that clinicians consistently overestimate survival. Two factors most associated with clinician error: More clinical experience correlates with less prognostic error Longer duration of patient-clinician relationship correlates with more prognostic error When to Discuss Prognosis Several studies suggest that across age and cultural background, most patients want their physicians to discuss prognostic information with them. Clinicians should discuss before a patient acutely decompensates and can process information. Earlier prognostic discussions have been shown to decrease rates of hospitalization and highly aggressive care (chemotherapy, pressors) in terminally ill cancer patients. How to Discuss Prognosis Common Four-Step Approach Confirm that the patient/family is ready to hear prognostic information Present info using a range: hours to days, days to weeks, weeks to months, months to years Allow silence after you provide information; respond to emotion Use prognostic information for eliciting end-of-life goals Ask-Tell-Ask Ask the patient what type of information would be most useful for them Provide information Ask patient if that answers their question or if they have additional ones Pairing Hope and Worry \"While I hope that x might happen, I worry that y is a possibility.\" Other Helpful Phrasing for Patients and Families Resistant to Discussing Prognosis \"In order to make this decision, it would be helpful if we talked about how much time you might have left to live. What are your thoughts on discussing this information?\" \"If you knew time was short for you, what would be important to you in making this decision?\" Palliative Care Network of Wisconsin Resources The Palliative Care Network of Wisconsin has several helpful \"Fast Facts\" on determining/communicating prognosis for specific disease states: https://www.mypcnow.org/fast-fact/prognosis-after-stroke/ https://www.mypcnow.org/fast-fact/prognosis-of-anoxic-ischemic-encephalopathy/ https://www.mypcnow.org/fast-fact/prognosis-in-hiv-and-aids/ https://www.mypcnow.org/fast-fact/prognosis-in-decompensated-liver-failure/ https://www.mypcnow.org/fast-fact/prognosis-in-end-stage-copd/ https://www.mypcnow.org/fast-fact/determining-prognosis-in-advanced-cancer/ Goals of Care Discussions Author: AJ Winer What is \"Goals of Care\" / a \"Goals of Care Discussion\"? A goals of care discussion is a phrase used to describe a specific type of serious illness conversation that aims to elicit a patient's priorities in the context of their illness. These discussions often cover code status, specific treatments, intensity of care, advanced care planning, withdrawal of support, and transitions to end of life care including hospice care. It is predicated on: (1) understanding a patient's wishes (2) informing a patient about their condition to (3) formulate a medically realistic treatment plan that aligns with the patient's values. When Do Goals of Care Discussions Come Up? When a patient's acute/chronic illness clinically worsens and there is concern about (1) a patient's recoverability to near baseline and/or (2) further decompensation Concerns that: (1) current interventions are ineffective, (2) current treatments are more harmful than beneficial, (3) a patient may require more intense/invasive therapy Strategies for Goals of Care (GOC) Discussions There is no best framework. Below are tools to guide your approach to a GOC discussion: The \"Three-Question Framework\" Source: El-Sourady, Martin. JPM 2021 Rationale: For patients with complex medical problems, it can be difficult to assess and articulate prognosis. This tool helps prepare and conduct GOC discussions. How it works: The three-question framework helps: (1) assess survivability (2) create potential medical trajectories (3) elicit a patient's wishes Example: Patient with metastatic lung cancer presents with septic shock due to pneumonia. Also has AKI. Q1: Is this acute condition survivable? \u2013 Make a problem list and consider a patient's baseline comorbidities. - If NO \u2192 deliver bad news and support - If YES or MAYBE \u2192 move to Question 2 - Resolution: While she may eventually die from cancer, she may be able to survive this acute illness. Q2: What would it take to survive this acute illness? Determine a best-case, worst-case, and most-likely scenario. Are they frail? Do they have baseline cognitive issues that would make recovery difficult? - If it is clear the patient cannot survive \u2192 deliver bad news and support - If it is possible to survive \u2192 move to question 3 - Resolution: Best case: recovery with minimal debility. Worse case: she dies. Most likely: she survives the acute illness but has a prolonged recovery that delays cancer treatment. She may need IV antibiotics and dialysis. Q3: Would the patient want to try treatment? Determine potential roads ahead for the patient. The following is one way to present treatment: \"Some patients would choose aggressive medical intervention in the hope of improving from acute illness. Other patients would decline aggressive treatment if there was little chance of recovery. Can you share with me what you hope for and what is off limits so we can make the right plan for you?\" - If NO \u2192 deliver bad news and support - If YES or MAYBE \u2192 discuss roads ahead, determine a realistic plan that aligns with a patient's goals and values Reference: https://doi.org/10.1089/jpm.2021.0282 The 'Headline' Definition: A Headline is a concise 1-2 sentence statement that summarizes a patient's medical issues and their clinical significance. It is used to communicate a clear, explicit message. Headlines should always include medical facts and meaning. Rationale for its use: Patients and families often do not understand the significance of medical facts if they do not have a medical background. When clinicians deliver bad news, they often communicate this information with vague messaging due to their own discomfort which results in more confusion for patients and families. Patient example: 80yoF with PMH metastatic lung cancer, in the ICU with septic shock due to pneumonia complicated by acute renal failure requiring dialysis. Example of a poor headline: \"Your mother has a pneumonia and is very, very sick.\" - This vague message can easily lead to misinterpretation and confusion. How to create an impactful headline: - Part 1 - Summarize the medical condition: \"Your mom was hospitalized with a lung infection that caused her kidneys to fail. Despite what we have done, her kidneys have not gotten better.\" - Part 2: Summarize what this means for the patient: \"Your mother is getting sicker despite treating her PNA and kidney failure. I am worried your mom is dying / she will die this hospitalization.\" Takeaway: A good headline provides a concise, clear message with information and meaning. The message needs to be explicit with minimal room for misinterpretation. REMAP Source: Childers et al, J Onc Practice, 2017 Definition: REMAP is a framework that provides a structure for GOC conversations. It stands for Reframe, Expect emotion, Map out patient values, Align with values, Propose plan. Rationale for its use: GOC discussions are difficult to navigate. It is difficult to break bad news, understand a patient's values, and develop an aligned plan of care. SPIKES is helpful for delivering bad news, but it is not all-encompassing. REMAP Explained (example patient: PMHx metastatic cancer, disease progression on 5th line tx): Reframe - Discuss plan isn't working. First assess a patient's understanding, then provide new info: \"What do you understand so far about the current medical situation? Would it be ok if to step back and talk about the big picture? We've been through a lot of treatments. I'm wondering if it's time to reevaluate where we are. More treatments might be doing more harm than good.\" Expect emotions - Allow room to process and respond with empathetic statements: \"This is hard to talk about. It is understandable that you would feel sad. I know this is not something you wanted to hear. I wish things were different.\" Ask permission to move forward: Is it ok if we talk about where to go from here? Map out values - Find out what is most important to the patient: To figure out a plan, ask open-ended questions to elicit what matters most: \"Given that time might be limited, what is most important to you now? What do you hope for? What do you worry about? As you look toward the future, are there things you would want to avoid? What does a good day look like for you now?\" Align with values - Before proposing a plan, confirm your understanding of the patient's values: \"It sounds like the most important things right now are to stay out of the hospital and to not be in pain so that you can enjoy time at home. Is that right?\" Propose plan - Develop a plan that matches these values: \"Is it okay if I make a recommendation? Given what you told me about your goal to be at home as much as possible and to focus on being comfortable, I would recommend that we focus on\u2026 How does that sound?\" Common Pitfalls of Goals of Care Discussions Overwhelming a patient - A patient or family may not be ready to receive all information at once. That is okay. Rarely is an immediate decision needed. Expecting too much \u2013 These discussions are a process. Often, the goal is to plant the seeds. If you have opened a line of communication, you have succeeded. Miscommunication - If the message is not clear (things are sugarcoated), a patient may misinterpret the message (see 'Headline' above). Do not rush \u2013 Pause when communicating. Patients and family need time to process, reflect, and ask questions. These conversations require careful planning, intentional communication, and your complete attention. Palliative Care and Consulting Palliative Care Author: AJ Winer What is Palliative Care? Palliative care is a specialty focused on supporting the best quality of life for patients facing serious illness. Palliative care aims to relieve suffering for patients of all stages of disease, whether the aim of treatment is cure, life prolongation, or maximizing quality of life. While palliative care does specialize in hospice care, the two have distinct approaches to patient care as described below. How is Palliative Care Different Than Hospice Care? Stage of Illness: Whereas hospice provides care and support to a patient with a prognosis of 6 months or less, palliative care helps patients at any stage of disease and is not limited by prognosis. Treatment Intent: Hospice care focuses on symptom control, quality of life, and transitioning with end-of-life care for patients with terminal illness. In contrast, palliative care is a supplement to current treatments; it can help patients who are receiving curative or life-prolonging treatment. Treatment team: For hospice care, a hospice physician and associated care team provide a patient's medical treatment. Palliative care, on the other hand, is provided in conjunction with a patient's primary physician and specialists. In What Ways Can Palliative Care Help? Symptoms \u2013 Palliative care can assist patients with serious illness who have severe, uncontrolled, or complex symptoms (pain, dyspnea, nausea, constipation). Communication \u2013 Palliative care can help communicate big picture discussions. Disposition \u2013 Palliative care can help with setting up hospice care or following up in outpatient palliative care clinic. Palliative care can also help transfer a patient to the palliative care unit (PCU). When are Appropriate Times to Consult Palliative Inpatient (vs Outpatient Referral)? Not all patients with end-stage illness (i.e., new metastatic cancer diagnosis) require inpatient palliative care consultation. If a patient is likely to discharge from the hospital, and their symptoms are adequately controlled, an outpatient consult may be most appropriate. Not all patients discharging with hospice care require palliative care consultation. Below are examples of encounters that may warrant consideration of an inpatient consult: Patient with complex symptoms that are inadequately controlled (ex: patient on suboxone in pain crisis, patient who has malignant SBO with uncontrolled nausea) Complex psychosocial and/or family dynamics (insufficient family support or complex family dynamics that may impact a patient's care) Hospice care with complex needs (patient with NG tube to suction, above scenarios) How Do I Introduce Palliative Care to a Patient? When considering involving palliative care to a patient, it is important to recognize that not all patients/families are aware of palliative care. Of those who have heard of it, some patients may initially have a negative impression due to false misconceptions (i.e., inaccurately equating palliative care with hospice care, believing it will interfere with current therapy). When introducing palliative care, it can be helpful to ask a patient if they have heard of it and what their understanding is. Example: Ms. Smith, 78yoF with severe COPD (compliant with therapy) presents from SNF for a 3rd exacerbation in 6 months. She weaned from BIPAP and her oxygen requirement and work of breathing have stabilized. She is full code. Your team discussed code status, but she is conflicted about \"not doing everything\" and wants to remain full code. She is frustrated by her recurrent hospitalizations and wants to maximize time outside the hospital. Your team wants to consult palliative care for a goals of care discussion. \"Ms. Smith, the last 6 months sound so challenging. Despite taking your medications, we're concerned that your COPD may be worse.\" \"That's what I figured. I'm tired of being in the hospital every other month.\" \"We think it may be a good idea to introduce you to our palliative care team. Have you heard of palliative care before?\" \"Is that for people with 6 months to live? I don't want that. I heard you have to stop some of your medications, and I want to use my inhalers.\" \"You might be thinking of hospice care. Palliative care is similar in that it aims to reduce suffering and maximize quality of life. It is a specialty just like pulmonology and helps support patients with serious illnesses like COPD. We often involve them to support someone with a chronic illness who has been hospitalized multiple times. They can help with managing symptoms and coming up with a plan for what interventions you would want if you were to become sicker. Think of them as an 'extra layer of support.' You do not have to stop any of your medications. I really think having the palliative care team will help us manage your care better.\" \"Yes, I would like to speak with them!\" Caring for Imminently Dying Patients Author: AJ Winer Overview Whether you are working in an ICU or the floor, you should be able to recognize the signs of a patient who is imminently dying. Signs and symptoms are broad and depend on the underlying etiology, but they frequently include changes in vital signs (bradycardia, arrhythmias, hypotension, hypoxia), decreased responsiveness, irregular breathing (rapid shallow breathing, apnea), difficulty clearing secretions, delirium. For patients receiving end-of-life (EOL) care, to minimize discomfort, it is important to discuss with patients, families, and interdisciplinary team members which interventions can be discontinued (i.e., lab draws, blood pressure monitoring, removing central line, A-line, etc.). These interventions should be referred to as \"withdrawal of support\" or \"withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy\" (rather than withdrawal of care). Certain patients (or a patient's family) may elect for compassionate extubation (see section below). Medications for Patients Who Are Imminently Dying General Recommendations At VUMC, there is a very helpful order set titled \"Comfort Care Orders (Trauma, MICU, SICU, NEURO ICU, Palliative Care)\" Make sure to remove unnecessary medications, labs, telemetry, nursing text orders, etc. Pain and Dyspnea Morphine 2mg IV or SQ q1h PRN (avoid if renal failure) Hydromorphone 0.25 \u2013 0.5mg IV or SQ q1h PRN Fentanyl 25-50mcg IV q15-30min PRN Fentanyl is not a great option in ICU unless already on a continuous fentanyl infusion (bolus lasts only 15 mins) Write as PRN, as needed for pain > 2/10 or for air hunger If ineffective after 1 hour, increase by 50-100% If given every hour for 3-4 hours, consider an infusion (given PRN dose as hourly rate). Alternatively, can use RDOS (see below) Dyspnea/Tachypnea Assess for volume overload, considering decrease or stopping IVFs or tube feeds Opioids are the treatment of choice for dyspnea Consider benzodiazepines for air hunger not controlled by opiates Supplemental oxygen for comfort (do not base on O2 sat). Consider use of cool air or fan Restlessness/Agitation/Anxiety Assess for urinary retention, constipation, pain, and other modifiable factors Lorazepam (Ativan) 0.5 \u2013 1 mg PO or IV q4h PRN (tablet can be made into slurry if patient is experiencing dysphagia) Secretions Position for comfort; side lying if possible to move sections Remember: The patient is NOT bothered by their own secretions, and it is often the family and caregivers who are likely disturbed, so avoid deep suctioning. Glycopyrrolate (Robinul\u2122) 0.2 \u2013 0.4 mg SQ or IV q6h PRN Atropine 1% ophthalmic solution 2 drops sublingual 2-4h PRN Compassionate Extubation and The Respiratory Distress Observation Scale (RDOS) Compassionate extubation (CE) refers to the termination of mechanical ventilation and the withdrawal of an artificial airway to avoid prolonged suffering at the EOL. CE replaces the older terminology (terminal wean, terminal extubation). The Respiratory Distress Observation Scale (RDOS) is a tool to help titrate medications for comfort during CE and EOL care. It uses 8 categories to create a respiratory distress score that guides medication administration. While it is used mostly by nursing and RT to decrease ventilator support and sustain comfort, it is important to know RDOS components. Components HR per min RR per min Restlessness (non-purposeful movements) Paradoxical breathing pattern Accessory muscle use Grunting at end-expiration Nasal flaring Look of fear Each of the 8 components is scored from 0-2 for increasing intensity. The scores are summed. Scores can range from 0-16, with 16 signifying the most severe distress. RDOS scores can be found under summary and flowsheet for patients undergoing CE. For Withdrawal of Support and Not on an Infusion RDOS goal <2. Assess RDOS q15min, dose morphine 2mg IV q10min for RDOS \u22654. If after 2 doses, RDOS 3-6 \u2192 increase bolus 50%; if RDOS >7 \u2192 increase bolus 100% If \u22652 bolus doses are given over 2 consecutive hours, start an infusion For Withdrawal of Support and On an Infusion If RDOS <4, maintain current infusion. Assess RDOS q15min during wean. If RDOS >4, bolus q10min If \u22652 bolus doses are given per hour, increase infusion Hospice Background Hospice: Aims to provide aggressive palliative care for patients at the end of their life, usually when life-prolonging treatment options have stopped. Eligibility: Less than or equal to 6-month life expectancy and goals are comfort Ensure patient is hospice minded (does not want to be readmitted, comfortable with foregoing routine blood work and scans) Ensure therapies can be covered by hospice (i.e., frequent blood transfusions, pulmonary HTN meds, dialysis) Consider: Palliative performance scale (PPS) rating of <50-60%, dependence in 3 of 6 ADLs, alteration in nutritional status, or documented deterioration in 4-6 months Levels of Care General inpatient care: Patients must require skilled nursing care that could not be provided at home (IV medications, suction, high flow O2). No cost to the patient under this level of care. Home hospice: Patients are discharged to their \"home,\" which could be a long-term care facility, assisted living facility, or their house. What is Covered? Personnel: - Hospice RN visits at least weekly and as needed; crisis on-call visits available 24/7 - SW, Chaplain, Hospice MD oversight - CNAs: usually 1 hr, 2-3/wk at most Other: - Medication for comfort - Durable medical equipment for comfort and safety including oxygen - Up to 13 months of bereavement for caregivers after the death - Respite care for 5 days, usually in a nursing home - Inpatient hospice at hospice facility or at certain hospitals for symptom control for up to 7 days Hospice can be offered to patients without insurance. VA Specifics for Hospice Main difference compared to VUMC is patient is allowed concurrent care This means vets can continue to receive some treatments for the primary condition (e.g., palliative radiation or chemotherapy) and still receive hospice services Additionally, all veterans that go on hospice should have any needed nursing home stay (at a contracted SNF) covered by the VA regardless of service connection VA Palliative Care team will help with these referrals One (1) F Status at the VA Designates \"treating specialty\" as NA-HOSPICE. Reduces costs for families, helps quality metrics. Use this if patient qualifies and agrees to hospice care Write Delayed Transfer Orders: Admit to NA-HOSPICE and Specialty as \"Hospice for Acute Care\" Write a nursing text order to \"Change Pt to 1-F Status\" The Death Pronouncement \u2013 Michael J. Neuss This scenario arises in a variety of contexts, including the units, wards, and cross-cover. You might know the patient and family well, but particularly when cross covering, that may not be the case. This approach to the death pronouncement is based in part on the AAFP's \"Death Pronouncement: Survival Tips for Residents\" (Am Fam Physician. 1998 Jul 1;58(1):284-285.) Before Entering Familiarize yourself with the most important points of the patient's hospitalization and recent events. Be aware of the circumstances of the patient's death, particularly whether death was expected or sudden. Inquire as to which family is present including whether the POA is currently at bedside. In general, it is best to enter accompanied, ideally with the patient's nurse. It is rare for the chaplain to be present but that might also be a consideration. In The Room Especially when cross-covering, make sure to introduce yourself to family, and allow them time to introduce themselves to you. Less is more when it comes to what you say: It can be good to be empathetic (consider only short statements such as \"I am sorry for your loss\"), but focus mainly on the task at hand, allowing time for families to be present with their loved one. Explain that you have been called to examine the patient to confirm that they have passed. Allow a brief time for questions; it is rare (but not impossible) that someone may wish to excuse themselves for the pronouncement. Note the location of a working clock when you enter; your watch is ok too but do make sure to avoid looking at your smartphone to check the time of death. The Exam and Pronouncement Identify the patient by wrist band Confirm that the patient does not respond to stimuli. One discreet way to confirm a lack of response to tactile stimuli is to hold the hand, and apply pressure to a nailbed, appearing to hold the hand while looking at/visually inspecting the face or other part of the body. Confirm the absence of spontaneous respirations and absence of heart sounds. Listen for a full minute as some patients have extended periods of apnea. Examine the pupils and note the absence of pupillary light reflex. Note the time at which your examination is completed. This is the time of death. Make sure to ask if the family would like an autopsy to be performed. This is often overlooked, and as awkward as it might feel to ask for this, it is a requirement. Make sure you have notified the attending of record. Please see further VA- and VUMC-specific guidance below Death Process in EPIC The key thing is to ensure that all components are completed in the \"Discharge as Deceased\" tab under the Transfer-Discharge screen. EACH AND EVERY component of this tab must be completed before Decedent Affairs will accept the body Required Steps Cardiopulmonary Death Charting \u2192 Select \"New Reading\" and complete. Cardiopulmonary Death \u2192 Select \"+Create Note\" Medical Examiner Criteria \u2192 Select \"+New Reading\" Criteria requiring notification of ME is listed in a drop-down menu in the navigator. Includes accidental deaths, threats to public health, suspicion for foul play, etc. The Vanderbilt Operator can assist with connecting you to the ME; alternatively, you can call 615-743-1800 during business hours (M-F 8am \u2013 4:30pm) or the after-hours pager at 800-216-0107. All patients diagnosed with Covid are automatic ME cases Autopsy Criteria \u2192 Select \"+New Reading\" Preliminary Cause of Death and Date/Time of Death \u2192 Rather than list \"Cardiopulmonary arrest,\" be specific (e.g., Pulmonary Embolism, Myocardial Infarction, Metastatic Colon Cancer, etc.) Deceased's Info \u2013 Report of Death If you need to leave this and return later after collecting information, you can access your partially complete entries by clicking on the date/time text that appears under the ribbon. This is not intuitive because the numbers listing the date/time do not at all appear as though they act like a hyperlink (but they do). Be specific. TDS will want you to have listed the name of the family you notified, the TDS Case Number (which the RN typically enters), and your attending physician's name (to sign the death certificate; give their pager number in this subsection). Report of Death Note \u2192 Select \"+New Reading\" and complete. Complete Synopsis + Hospital Course and then at the very bottom under Summary of Death select \"+Create Note.\" Once all of this paperwork is finished, be sure to touch base with the patient's nurse, usually contact Decedent Affairs and assist in making sure the body is moved Death Process at the VA DEATH PRONOUNCEMENT PROCESS (Updated June 2021): Nurse will notify physician at time of death for pronouncement with a text page, indicating physician should arrive within 15 minutes or ASAP. Physician will arrive to pronounce patient's death within 30 minutes of notification by nursing staff, preferably within 15 minutes. Physician will alert nursing staff if there will be a delay in arrival to pronounce. Physician to examine patient and pronounce death\u2014offering family chaplain support and informing family of death. Family is not required to remain at bedside or come to the hospital if not at bedside at time of pronouncement. Family can complete documentation/consent forms with decedent affairs clerk at later time by phone. Physician at time of pronouncement will ask family regarding VA benefit of autopsy either by phone or if present at the bedside. VA pays for the autopsy and this is provided as a benefit to the family if requested. Physician will document if the family agreed to or declined the autopsy and will inform the nursing staff regarding the family's decision. Please also inform nursing staff of time of death as soon as possible. Page Pathology Resident on call to notify them of any Autopsy request. Additionally, work with Decedent Affairs (DA) during business hours or the Administrator on Duty (AOD) to complete the autopsy consent located in iMed Consent. Physician will document the death pronouncement using the Death Note-Inpatient template in CPRS. Death notes should be completed as soon as possible, preferably within 1 hour of pronouncement. Nursing staff calls and notifies TN donor services of death within 60 minutes of a death and after receiving the time of death from the physician pronouncing death. The family of the patient is allowed time to grieve and receive emotional support from various staff, including chaplains who are on call 24/7. Once the family is ready to leave the patient's room, nursing staff will call the Decedent Affairs Clerk during business hours or the AOD if death occurs after business hours-such as on weekends, nights, or holidays. The patient's remains are removed from the room within 4 hours of death and taken to the morgue to await transfer to the families' choice of funeral homes. The physician will complete a death summary, which is a Discharge Summary (Med/Neuro/Surg) with option of Death Summary that will summarize the hospital course and the death event. This should be completed within 24 hours. Advanced Directives Author: Manasa Atyam Advance directives are legal documents that allow a patient to express their preferences on quality of life, medical care and health care decision makers in the event they lose the ability to make their own decisions. Advance care directives remain valid indefinitely. If an advance care directive does not reflect a patient's wishes, a new document should be executed and a note should be entered into the EMR stating that the current document is no longer valid. The most common types of advance care directives are: Living Will This document specifies which medical treatments a patient would be willing to pursue and allow an individual to describe preference about quality of life. Specifically, the living will allow a patient to express their wishes on life support, cardiac resuscitation, artificial hydration, and nutrition. A living will must either be signed by two witnesses or notarized. It does not require a lawyer. Healthcare Power of Attorney (HPOA) This document allows a patient to legally designate one to two people to make healthcare decisions if a patient loses capacity. The designated HPOA should make decisions reflective of the patient's own choices, using substituted judgment. Recognizing that patients may change their wishes on medical care over time, the HPOA may trump the living will in situations where the choices in the living will no longer reflect the patient's current wishes on health care. Physician Order for Scope of Treatment (POST) This is a physician order that specifies which medical interventions should be attempted (CPR, mechanical ventilation, artificial hydration, and nutrition). Additionally, it details under what circumstances a patient would like to be hospitalized and which types of inpatient hospital settings (ICU vs. avoid the ICU) are consistent with their goals. The POST form is valid in the community (including long term care facilities, senior centers, and dialysis units) and in the emergency department. It is preferable but not required for a patient or their surrogate to sign the POST form. Any patient that is DNR or DNR/DNI must have a completed POST form when transferring by ambulance. You can download the form from MedEx or find them here: https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/health/healthprofboards/hcf/Post_Form.pdf How Are Advance Care Directives Different From Code Status? Advance care directives are documents that a patient fills out to describe their wishes on medical care. Code status is a physician order completed by a health care provider. It is important to remind patients and families that even if a patient has a completed living will declining CPR/mechanical ventilation, the health care providers will assume the patient desires CPR/mechanical ventilation, unless an appropriate code status order is entered. A new code status order must be entered at each admission. If a patient had a code status order placed when he/she lacked capacity and then regains capacity on admission, code status must be readdressed with the patient. TN Advance Care Planning The state of Tennessee created a form that combined the contents of a living will and POA. This includes: - Agent and when they become effective - Defining quality of life - Wishes for treatment when quality of life is unacceptable (as defined in previous section), and condition is irreversible - CPR - Life support (intubation, IVF, pressors) - Treatment of new conditions that arise (i.e., antibiotics for new infection) - Tube feeding/artificial nutrition - Other instructions (free text) - Organ donation - Signature of person + 2 witnesses (not POA) or notary Outpatient: Discussions on health care decision makers, wishes on medical treatment (particularly CPR), mechanical ventilation and artificial hydration and nutrition should be done periodically with all patients over the age of 18. This conversation should be part of the annual visit, especially for those with chronic health conditions, changes in functional status or a new diagnosis of a serious disease. Inpatient: Can ask SW to assist with providing these forms Acute and Chronic Pain Authors: Thomas Horton, Soibhan Kelley There are physiological AND emotional components to pain. Biopsychosocial factors must be addressed. Ex: anxiety/depression, physical debility, and poor social support. Many patients will never be completely free of pain, so it is important to set realistic expectations. Central sensitization is a phenomenon where the nervous system persists in a state of high reactivity which lowers the threshold for pain stimuli. Two characteristics of centralized pain are allodynia (pain from non-painful stimuli) and hyperalgesia (painful stimuli perceived as more painful). Pharmacologic Therapy Opioid Therapy Opioids: Frequently used in hospital for acute pain. Limit use as much as possible in chronic pain as it contributes to long-term central sensitization. May benefit some patient populations but should always be used as a component of a comprehensive, multimodal, patient-specific treatment plan. Refer to section under \"Opioids: General Principles and Conversions\" for OME equivalents If >80 OME per day, ensure patient is prescribed naloxone If >120 OME per day, refer to pain clinic Common choices for acute pain in hospital (always start at low end for opioid na\u00efve): Oxycodone (PO) 5-10mg q4 to 6 hours prn Hydromorphone (IV) 0.25 to 1mg q2 to 3 hours prn For patients on opioids at home, should always continue in hospital to avoid withdrawal unless clinically contraindicated. Can always titrate dose as needed. Tramadol - Has opioid and NSAID properties. Of note, tramadol also inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 so there is variability between patients. Typical dose: 25 to 50mg q4 to 6 hours PRN Buprenorphine \u2013 sublingual (Subutex, suboxone), buccal (Belbuca), transdermal (Butrans). Increased affinity to mu opioid receptor. Slower disassociation leads to prolonged analgesia. Preferably acts on spinal receptors (vs CNS). Can precipitate withdrawal. Increase 1st pass metabolism \u2192 low bioavailability. Ok to use in mild-mod hepatic dysfunction but avoid in severe impairment. See Opioid section for dosing. Adjuvant Therapy Acetaminophen: 650mg q6hr or 1g q8h. <3g/day. (<2g in liver patients) - Avoid if you are worried about masking fevers NSAIDs: A great option for acute pain, especially musculoskeletal, headache, and nephrolithiasis in eligible patients (IV/PO ketorolac, ibuprofen, naproxen, etc.) - Avoid in acute or chronic kidney disease and \u2191 risk of bleeding. Caution in CAD/PVD Topical analgesics: Best for localized pain but utilized frequently as part of a multimodal regimen - Lidocaine ointment/patches, menthol salicylate gel, Diclofenac gel, Capsaicin gel, Morphine gel (typically limited to oncology patients with tumor breakdown through skin) Neuropathic pain (sciatica, peripheral neuropathy): Neuropathic agents are best for neuropathic pain but can be tried for chronic pain or as part of acute pain regimen. SNRIs and TCAs can provide additional benefit if a patient has comorbid depression, anxiety, or insomnia (TCA). Most agents take 6-8 weeks for peak effect. - Gabapentin (Initial: 100 to 300 mg 1 to 3 times daily). Can be used for acute pain - Pregabalin (Initial: 25 to 150 mg/day in 2 to 3 divided doses). Has better bioavailability. May work in patients who did not tolerate or did not have success with gabapentin - Duloxetine (Initial: 30 mg daily for 1 to 2 weeks, then increase to 60 mg daily as tolerated) - Amitriptyline (Initial: 10 to 25 mg once daily at bedtime) MSK Pain (pulled muscle, muscle spasm): Muscle relaxants: Should be used temporarily and intermittently but some benefit from longer term use. Great for paraplegia, spinal injury, and spasticity - Methocarbamol (Initial: 1.5 g 3 to 4 times daily for 2 to 3 days then decrease dose to \u22644.5 g/day in 3 to 4 divided doses). Preferred initial agent as has least SE. - Tizanidine (Initial: 2 to 4 mg every 6 to 12 hours as needed and/or at bedtime) \u2013 important to watch out for withdrawal in patients that take frequently at home. - Cyclobenzaprine (Initial: 5 to 10 mg once daily before bedtime) - Metaxalone (Oral: 800 mg 3 to 4 times daily) NSAID, Tylenol, and topical analgesics are also effective Visceral pain (pain from organ distension such as splenomegaly): - Steroids, opioids, NSAIDs Other: NMDA antagonists: Usually prescribed by our pain management colleagues but worthwhile to think about as a potential option if a patient's pain continues to be difficult to control - Ketamine (IV infusion): SE includes AMS/delirium, hallucinations, and dissociation. - Memantine (PO) Alpha 2 agonists (central pain): Not commonly utilized in everyday practice, but helpful in certain patients with chronic pain (off-label), guanfacine vs. clonidine Acute Pain for Special Populations Renal Dysfunction Check that meds are renally dosed and start with non-sedating options. Avoid NSAIDs, morphine, and codeine. - Acetaminophen and topicals - Opioids: oxycodone 2.5 to 5 mg, IV hydromorphone 0.25-0.5mg, fentanyl IV 25 to 50mcg - Gabapentin: Start with spot 100mg. Be extremely careful with quick up titration in CKD due to sedation risk. - Methocarbamol: no specific renal dosing, try 500-750mg initially Cirrhosis Always avoid NSAIDs, morphine, codeine, hydromorphone (may be OK in mild to moderate cirrhosis). - Acetaminophen (2g max/d) and topicals are safe - Gabapentin: start with spot 100mg - Methocarbamol: no specific hepatic dosing, try 500 mg initially - Opioids: - At risk for increased accumulation of toxic metabolites or increased bioavailability due to decreased first pass metabolism, liver synthetic dysfunction, and protein binding (hypoalbuminemia) i.e., opioids are stronger and last longer than expected - May precipitate hepatic encephalopathy - Degree of hepatic dysfunction determines risk of toxicity - Compensated cirrhosis without synthetic dysfunction is no different than general population - Avoid opioids if decompensated especially with hepatic encephalopathy - Generally, decrease typical starting doses by 50% and increase dosing intervals (start low and go slow) History of Substance Use Disorder Overnight, always review handoff as day team likely has specific plan in place. - With substance use history, typically rely on multimodal agents as above. Patients who are in recovery may prefer to avoid opioids themselves. - However, patients with OUD can and do have acute, severe pain due to injury, infections, procedures, etc. NEVER withhold opiates if clinically appropriate, regardless of substance use history. Uncontrolled Pain Despite Significant Opioids Consider consulting the Pain Service for ketamine infusion (or lidocaine infusion if neuropathic pain component) - Consider addiction psychiatry consult, palliative care consult, and/or chronic pain service consult. - The consult is \"inpatient consult to anesthesia or pain service\". Most often, you will select \"Chronic Pain Service\" for ketamine drips - \"Acute Pain\" may be appropriate for a peripheral nerve block (PNB). Less frequently used service, but would consider PNB in patients with well-localized, severe pain if: opioid intolerant, are at risk of respiratory depression related to systemic opioids (OSA, lung disease, age), or pain is poorly managed despite systemic medication.

Opioid Pharmacokinetics Mechanism Onset Peak Effect Duration PO 30 min 1 hr 3 \u2013 4 hrs IV 5-10 min 15 min 1 \u2013 2 hrs General Opioid Principles When first starting opioids, start short-acting as needed with availability based on half-life When a patient is requiring 4-5 PRN doses/24h, consider starting long acting Transitioning between opiates: use oral morphine equivalents (OMEs). Each drug's potency is compared to oral morphine (table). Ex: 1 mg IV morphine = 3 mg PO morphine Up titrating the dose of the same opioid: increase dose by 25-50% for moderate pain (4-7/10) and 50-100% for severe pain (8-10/10) Transitioning between opioids: reduce OME by 1/4 to 1/3 to account for cross tolerance Example: if switching from oxycodone 10mg q4h PRN to morphine ER q12h: calculate 24H OME \u2192 60 (total mg in 24h) x 1.5 (conversion) = 90 OME \u2192 reduce by 25-33% \u2192 60-67.5 OME \u2192 morphine ER 30mg q12h IR/ER regimens: Consider switching to ER when requiring 3-4 doses of IR medications in a 24h period regularly. The ER medication should treat the chronic pain experienced by a patient. The IR preparation is for breakthrough pain. Each IR dose should be ~10-20% of the total OME dose a patient takes daily. Example (using above case): total OME 90 \u2192 10-20% = (9-18mg) is ~15mg \u2192 divide by 1.5 (converts back to oxycodone which is 1.5x as strong) \u2192 oxycodone 10mg q4h PRN breakthrough Fentanyl patches: Replaced q72h. When converting from oral morphine to fentanyl patch \u2192 divide 24h OME by 2 or 3 \u2192 gives ~dose of fentanyl patch in mcg/hr q72h To calculate VUMC patient's 24-hour OME: Go to patient Summary \u2192 pain and sedation tab or morphine equivalence tab Buprenorphine Pharmacokinetics Route Sublingual Buccal Transdermal Brand Names Subutex, Suboxone Belbuca Butrans Onset of Action 30-60 min 30-60 min 18-24 hours Buprenorphine Conversion to OME Buprenorphine OME/24hrs 7 15 30 48 60 80 100 120 300 Transdermal (TD) patch 5mcg/hr q7days 5mcg/hr q7days 10mcg/hr q7days 20mcg/hr q7days Buccal patch 75mcg daily 150mcg q12hrs 300mcg q12hrs 450mcg q12hrs 600mcg q12hrs 750mcg q12hrs 750mcg q12hrs 900mcg q12hrs Sublingual (SL) tabs 1mg BID (split 2mg tabs) 1mg BID (split 2mg tabs) 1mg TID 2mg TID Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) Pumps can be programmed to deliver a continuous rate and/or a bolus dose Basal rate: A continuous infusion dosed per hour that cannot be adjusted by the patient Demand dose: A patient-directed bolus that is given at a prescribed frequency whenever the patient presses the button. Both the dose and frequency can be adjusted. The general rule of thumb is to calculate the total OME delivered through the demand when a patient is in steady state and convert 75% of this dose into the total continuous rate. Calculating Initial Doses Basal dose: Check what the patient is actually taking at home (may be different than what is prescribed, use OME). Take the total daily dose and convert to IV and then divide that by 24 hours to get an hourly rate. If moderate pain, increase dose by 25-50%; if severe, by 50-100%. Demand doses: The bolus dose should be 10-20% of total daily dose. The availability is based on the half-life of the medication (2hr for IV). Adjust the availability based on how frequently you want patient to be able to have a demand dose (e.g., if q10min divide by 12 or if q15min divide by 8 for 2 hours) Don't forget to set lockouts (maximum dose that can be given over a certain period of time) that includes both basal and demand doses Remember that the basal rate will not get to steady state for at least 8 hrs. When you admit patients or are transitioning to a PCA, always initiate the PCA pump with a bolus (or loading) dose How to Order PCA at VUMC Select Analgesic: - Hydromorphone (most common): Order \"Hydromorphone (DILAUDID) PCA\" - Fentanyl (if on at home; not a good inpatient PCA): Order \"Fentanyl PCA\" - Morphine: Order \"Morphine PCA\" \u2192 pick from 3 different concentrations (mg/mL = 1:1, 5:1, 10:1). 1:1 is often suggested for start. 5mg/mL for patients requiring more than 60mg/24h. 10mg/mL for patients requiring more than 300mg/24h. Avoid basal rate if renal impairment) Select \"[Analgesic] PCA syringe\" and adjust the following to patient's needs: - PCA Dose (\"Demand\"): amount the patient gets when s/he presses the button - Lockout Interval: time between which \"demand\" doses will not be administered if s/he presses the button (i.e., the PCA \"locks out\") - Continuous Dose (\"Basal\"): amount the patient gets per hr. in continuous infusion - Max Dose: maximum amount of analgesic (Basal + Demand) patient can get in 24 hours Select \"IV Carrier Fluid Options\" > Choose Fluid option Select all \"PCA Nursing Orders\" How to Order PCA at VA Under Orders, select \"Pain/Sedation Infusions\" Under \"PCAs,\" select Analgesic of choice (Hydromorphone or Morphine) Adjust the following: Load: amount the patient will receive on initial set up of PCA Basal: amount the patient gets per hour in continuous infusion Demand: amount the patient gets when s/he presses the button Interrogating PCA (to determine amount of analgesia patient received) Look at IV pump display and hit \"Channel Select\" on PCA Select \"Options\" in bottom left of IV pump Select \"Pt History\" on the left of the screen. This shows the administration history for a certain time period (e.g., 24h, 12h, 4h, etc.) Hit \"Zoom\" on bottom of screen to change time period to 24 hours. Should show: Total Drug: total amount of drug received in last 24 hours Total Demands: amount of times the patient had pushed the button for demand dose Delivered: amount of times the patient actually received a demand dose The difference between \"Total Demands\" and \"Delivered\" is the number of times the patient pushed the button without receiving a dose If you have questions about interrogating the PCA, ask your patient's bedside RN. Opioid Side Effects Constipation: Dose-dependent and will not develop tolerance. If patient is taking opioids, s/he need robust bowel regimen (MiraLAX, senna) with goal of BM \u2265every 3 days - For opioid-specific constipation can do SQ Relistor\u2122 (methylnaltrexone), but this is expensive and can only be given in the PCU or oncology floors at VUMC. For patients with chronic opioid-induced constipation as an outpatient, can trial oral agents like Movantik\u2122 (Naloxegol\u2122). Can also consider PO naloxone but it does have small amount of bioavailability so watch for systemic reversal. Nausea: Occurs with opiate na\u00efve patients. Consider starting an anti-emetic concurrently. Most patients will develop tachyphylaxis with this over a day, so the antiemetic can be discontinued. Urinary retention: Consider role of opioids in patients with new-onset or worsening urinary retention. Try to de-escalate opioid dosing if possible. Overdose: In patients with apneic emergency, IV 0.4 mg Naloxone; however, low threshold for multiple doses until response. For patients prescribed opioids as outpatient, need naloxone 4 mg intranasal. - If a patient with chronic opiate dependence is over sedated but not in immediate danger of respiratory failure, one can 1) hold the dose of opioid and let them wake up on their own or 2) give a dose of naloxone 0.02-0.04mg (1/10 of the usual dose). This latter strategy prevents opioid withdrawal and precipitation of pain crisis in patients on chronic opioids. Pruritis: Due to histamine release from mast cells; can be treated with antihistamines. The opioid can also be rotated. Some but not all patients will develop tachyphylaxis. Toxicity: Hyperalgesia and neuroexcitatory effects (AMS, myoclonic jerking, seizures). Risk factors for neuroexcitatory effects are rapid titration, dehydration, and/or renal failure. Treatment is to rotate to a higher potency opioid and hydrate when possible. Non-pharmacologic Therapies Procedural Intervention: Best utilized when there is a specific, targetable source - Referral to chronic/interventional pain management (Nerve blocks or Radio-ablative therapy) and neurosurgery (chordotomy, cingulotomy, myelotomy) Adjunct therapies: Patients will have varying opinions and responses on adjunctive therapies, but these can be as important as any pharmacologic therapy.

JPM 2021 Rationale: For patients with complex medical problems, it can be difficult to assess and articulate prognosis. This tool helps prepare and conduct GOC discussions. How it works: The three-question framework helps: (1) assess survivability (2) create potential medical trajectories (3) elicit a patient's wishes Example: Patient with metastatic lung cancer presents with septic shock due to pneumonia. Also has AKI. Q1: Is this acute condition survivable? \u2013 Make a problem list and consider a patient's baseline comorbidities. - If NO \u2192 deliver bad news and support - If YES or MAYBE \u2192 move to Question 2 - Resolution: While she may eventually die from cancer, she may be able to survive this acute illness. Q2: What would it take to survive this acute illness? Determine a best-case, worst-case, and most-likely scenario. Are they frail? Do they have baseline cognitive issues that would make recovery difficult? - If it is clear the patient cannot survive \u2192 deliver bad news and support - If it is possible to survive \u2192 move to question 3 - Resolution: Best case: recovery with minimal debility. Worse case: she dies. Most likely: she survives the acute illness but has a prolonged recovery that delays cancer treatment. She may need IV antibiotics and dialysis. Q3: Would the patient want to try treatment? Determine potential roads ahead for the patient. The following is one way to present treatment: \"Some patients would choose aggressive medical intervention in the hope of improving from acute illness. Other patients would decline aggressive treatment if there was little chance of recovery. Can you share with me what you hope for and what is off limits so we can make the right plan for you?\" - If NO \u2192 deliver bad news and support - If YES or MAYBE \u2192 discuss roads ahead, determine a realistic plan that aligns with a patient's goals and values Reference: https://doi.org/10.1089/jpm.2021.0282","title":"The \"Three-Question Framework\""},{"location":"Palliative%20Care/#the-headline","text":"Definition: A Headline is a concise 1-2 sentence statement that summarizes a patient's medical issues and their clinical significance. It is used to communicate a clear, explicit message. Headlines should always include medical facts and meaning. Rationale for its use: Patients and families often do not understand the significance of medical facts if they do not have a medical background. When clinicians deliver bad news, they often communicate this information with vague messaging due to their own discomfort which results in more confusion for patients and families. Patient example: 80yoF with PMH metastatic lung cancer, in the ICU with septic shock due to pneumonia complicated by acute renal failure requiring dialysis. Example of a poor headline: \"Your mother has a pneumonia and is very, very sick.\" - This vague message can easily lead to misinterpretation and confusion. How to create an impactful headline: - Part 1 - Summarize the medical condition: \"Your mom was hospitalized with a lung infection that caused her kidneys to fail. Despite what we have done, her kidneys have not gotten better.\" - Part 2: Summarize what this means for the patient: \"Your mother is getting sicker despite treating her PNA and kidney failure. I am worried your mom is dying / she will die this hospitalization.\" Takeaway: A good headline provides a concise, clear message with information and meaning.

It is difficult to break bad news, understand a patient's values, and develop an aligned plan of care. SPIKES is helpful for delivering bad news, but it is not all-encompassing. REMAP Explained (example patient: PMHx metastatic cancer, disease progression on 5th line tx): Reframe - Discuss plan isn't working. First assess a patient's understanding, then provide new info: \"What do you understand so far about the current medical situation? Would it be ok if to step back and talk about the big picture? We've been through a lot of treatments. I'm wondering if it's time to reevaluate where we are. More treatments might be doing more harm than good.\" Expect emotions - Allow room to process and respond with empathetic statements: \"This is hard to talk about. It is understandable that you would feel sad. I know this is not something you wanted to hear. I wish things were different.\" Ask permission to move forward: Is it ok if we talk about where to go from here? Map out values - Find out what is most important to the patient: To figure out a plan, ask open-ended questions to elicit what matters most: \"Given that time might be limited, what is most important to you now? What do you hope for? What do you worry about? As you look toward the future, are there things you would want to avoid? What does a good day look like for you now?\" Align with values - Before proposing a plan, confirm your understanding of the patient's values: \"It sounds like the most important things right now are to stay out of the hospital and to not be in pain so that you can enjoy time at home. Is that right?\" Propose plan - Develop a plan that matches these values: \"Is it okay if I make a recommendation?

When introducing palliative care, it can be helpful to ask a patient if they have heard of it and what their understanding is.

The scale is graded with letters: ASIA A: complete SCI with no sensory or motor function preserved (at least no sensory or motor function preserved in sacral segments S4-S5). ASIA A patients also have no voluntary anal contraction or deep anal pressure. ASIA B: a sensory incomplete injury with complete motor function loss ASIA C: a motor incomplete injury where there is some movement, but less than half of the muscle groups below the neurologic level of injury are anti-gravity (can lift against the force of gravity with full ROM) ASIA D: a motor incomplete injury with more than half of the muscle groups anti-gravity ASIA E: neurologically intact 17,000 SCIs occur annually. Most are traumatic (MVC and falls are the most common causes), but some are \"acquired,\" such as from tumors, spinal stroke, and/or abscesses which are also considered non-traumatic SCIs. Assessment and Classification Mechanism of injury Other injuries; greater than 50% of cases have concurrent TBI Surgical vs non-surgical intervention International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI (ISNCSCI) Exam Full neurological assessment including manual muscle testing bilaterally for upper and lower extremities, sensory exam to light touch AND pinprick at each dermatome, sacral sensation and rectal exam for deep anal pressure and voluntary anal contraction Determine sensory level, motor level, neurological level of injury (NLI), and completeness of injury for prognostication Note in regions where there is no myotome to test (thoracic region), the motor level is presumed to be the same as sensory level NLI: most caudal segment of the cord with intact sensation and anti-gravity (3 or more) muscle function strength, if there is normal (intact) sensory and motor function Classification uses ASIA ISCNSCI exam including bilateral sensory level, bilateral motor level, NLI, injury completeness (complete vs incomplete), and AIS Impairment Score Management Neurogenic Bowel Depending on the level, can lead to constipation or fecal incontinence - Bowel regimen (stool softeners and laxatives) with bowel program (up out of the bed to shower chair for an enema every day to every other day) - Goal: 1 BM every day during bowel program without incontinence in-between Neurogenic Bladder Main concerns include urinary retention and incontinence - Managed acutely with foley or straight catheter. Note, even if the patient has urine output, it does not mean that they are not retaining. It may represent overflow incontinence. Autonomic Dysreflexia An abnormal state of sympathetic overdrive from a noxious stimulus - Unique complication in T6 level or above injuries - Symptoms: flushing, sweating, headache, relative hypertension, tachycardia, lightheadedness, nausea, anxiety - Immediate treatment: sit the patient upright and remove all tight clothing - Next step: determine source/noxious stimuli - Most common causes: urinary retention and constipation followed by tight clothing, pressure wound, infection - HTN treatment: nitro-paste on the forehead (does not work on the chest if patient had an injury above the chest, which includes all cervical injuries and most upper thoracic injuries) Pressure Injuries q2H turns and instruction on pressure relief. Engage wound care and nursing as needed. Spasticity Author: Bailey Frei Background Spasticity is a velocity-dependent increase in resistance to passive stretch. It differs from hypertonia, which is resistance to passive stretch that is not velocity-dependent Spasticity is believed to result from disruption of descending inhibitory modulation of the alpha motor neurons by an upper motor lesion, producing hyperexcitability Grading (by the Modified Ashworth Scale) 0: no increase in tone 1: slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of ROM when affected part is moved in flexion or extension 1+: slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch followed by minimal resistance through the remainder of ROM (less than 50%) 2: more marked increase in muscle tone through most of ROM, but affected part is easily moved 3: considerable increases in muscle tone; passive movement difficult 4: affected part is rigid in flexion or extension Management Spasticity can have functional benefits, including improving standing and transfers. However, it can also cause weakness, poor dexterity, pain, and contractures. If spasticity is having undesirable effects, the first line of treatment is PT/OT and physical modalities such as stretching. Oral medications are the next line of treatment. Medication Mechanism of Action Side Effects/Important Considerations Baclofen GABA-B agonist sedation, fatigue, nausea, centrally acting - risk of withdrawal Tizanidine Alpha-2 agonist sedation, dizziness, xerostomia, weakness, centrally acting - risk of withdrawal Diazepam GABA-A agonist sedation, confusion, hypotension, centrally acting - risk of withdrawal Dantrolene inhibits Ca release from sarcoplasmic reticulum weakness, sedation, nausea, hepatotoxicity, acts directly on skeletal muscle Intrathecal baclofen: reserved for patients who have significant side effects with oral anti-spasticity medications or who have severe, persistent, and diffuse spasticity despite maximal doses Injections Botulinum toxin: Blocks the presynaptic release of acetylcholine from motor endplates of the lower motor neuron at the myoneural junction. Effect usually lasts 3-8 months Alcohol block: Phenol and ethanol are neurolytic agents that can be used to block nerves with motor function. Surgeries Selective dorsal rhizotomy, osteotomy, muscle tendon lengthening, release, or transfer If a patient experiences worsening of spasticity, it is important to consider other underlying conditions such as infections, pressure ulcers, constipation, or bladder distention Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Author: Bailey Frei Background TBI is categorized as a disruption in brain function due to an external blow or force leading to decreased consciousness, memory deficits, neurological deficits, or intracranial lesion. Most common causes of TBI are falls and MVC. Falls are the most common cause of TBI in elderly population Assessment Mechanism of injury Initial GCS Loss of consciousness and duration Other injuries Initial evaluation should include a non-contrasted head CT to rule out hemorrhage Full neuro exam including but not limited to cranial nerves, strength, cognition (orientation), memory, reflexes, sensation, cerebellar testing, range of motion of joints, Babinski, and Hoffmann's Classification Severity GCS Loss of Consciousness Post-Traumatic Amnesia Mild 13-15 0-30 min 0-1 day Moderate 9-12 30 min - 24 hrs 1-7 days Severe 3-8 >24 hrs >7 days Evaluation and Management Acutely, patients are at risk for seizures, agitation, autonomic dysfunction, bowel or bladder dysfunction, wounds, vertigo, headaches, cognitive impairment, venous thrombosis, and spasticity.

With every patient, consider LENGTH, LOCATION, LUMENS, and LINE TYPE! Central Line Length Insertion Site Rec Length (for pt height > 5'5\") Right IJ or Subclavian 15 cm Left IJ or Subclavian 20 cm Femoral 25 cm Confirm length of catheter in your kit before you open/place the line! Type of Line Type of Line Uses Special Considerations Triple Lumen (7Fr) Central access for vasopressors, caustic infusions Consider lumens needs; triple lumen is most versatile but can warrant dual lumen MAC or Cordis 'Short and fat' allowing rapid transfusion; MAC has two parts and can float a PA catheter through it MAC is placed with dilator still in introducer Dialysis Catheter (Trialysis, 12 Fr) Dialysis line with two 12 Ga. Lumens for dialysis with a third 17 Ga. lumen for added access Two serial dilations *Can place triple lumen in MAC for additional ports; lose ability to rapidly transfuse Site Selection Site Advantages Disadvantages Internal Jugular Vein Minimal risk of PTX; improve target with positioning and use of US; easily compressible if bleeding occurs Risk of carotid puncture, difficult in obese patient; vein collapsibility with hypovolemia Subclavian More comfortable for patients; landmark driven approach; lowest risk infection Increased risk of PTX, harder to control bleeding with pressure, technically more difficult Femoral Easiest to access, no risk of PTX, can be placed during CPR and intubation Very Difficult in obese patients (pannus); target vessel is shorter (before branching) and deeper than IJ; should be done under inguinal ligament to prevent retroperitoneal bleed vs compressible leg bleed. Procedural Considerations Cap side ports with blue claves (not included in Trialysis kit) prior to flushing For IJ access, place patient in slight Trendelenburg position to engorge vein While advancing needle, ensure constant negative pressure with aspiration of plunger and visualization of needle tip with US Designate someone to watch tele while threading guidewire to monitor for arrhythmias. Limit guidewire insertion depth to no more than 16 cm to reduce arrhythmia risk Always ensure guidewire is secured while it is inside a vein Always ensure target for venous cannulation is visualized and guidewire is placed correctly prior to dilation: 1) Compression of target vessel 2) Non-pulsatile dark blood return (unless on 100% FiO2, may be brighter red) 3) US visualization of needle and wire 4) can use pressure tubing and angiocath to confirm CVP or obtain venous O2 sat. Supplies Table Sterile gloves and gown Mask, hair covering, and eye protection Ultrasound with linear probe Ultrasound cover (check length; shorter ones may not reach sterile field) Chlorhexidine x3 Central line kit, which typically includes: Lidocaine, syringe for lidocaine, small gauge needle to deliver lidocaine Full body Drape Skin prep solution Syringes Scalpel Sterile gauze Catheter, dilator, needle, wire Suture and needle driver Saline flushes (note that while the saline is sterile, the plastic syringes are not); the saline will need to be transferred to an empty reservoir in the kit; and then utilized using sterile syringes included in the kit Blue claves to cap side ports x 3; for dialysis access, ClearGuard antimicrobial caps are preferred Optional items: Back up or larger sterile dressing (the ones in kit might be too small or dropped) Micropuncture kits for added safety in case of arterial puncture, especially during high bleeding risk cases Lidocaine with epinephrine if high bleeding risk Backup guidewire Small tegaderms to secure edges of full body drape Procedural considerations Timeout with nursing prior to starting Double check that the correct type & size of catheter kit has been selected for the target site (for instance, triple lumen catheters typically only have one size; but dialysis catheters have varying lengths) For all ultrasound guided procedures, try to position the machine such that the direction of needle insertion will face the screen Numb patient immediately after draping, prior to set up to allow time for lidocaine to work. Complete both subcutaneous skin wheal as well as deeper lidocaine administration with ultrasound guidance. Note that deeper numbing is not without additional risk \u2013 it may be more painful to try to locate your needle on ultrasound to numb safely than to just pursue venopuncture. Set supplies up in exactly the order of use to ensure all are present and functioning (and to create space; for instance, suturing/dressing to the side) Cap side ports with blue claves prior to flushing, leaving the middle/longest port uncapped for passage of the guidewire It is very important to make sure side ports are clamped, especially during dialysis catheter placement (since the side ports are typically not capped during insertion) Flush all ports For IJ access, place patient in slight Trendelenburg position to engorge vein While advancing needle, monitor for successful venopuncture both through visualization of the needle tip on US but also through continuous aspiration of the syringe plunger Designate someone to watch telemetry while threading guidewire to monitor for arrhythmias; limit guidewire insertion depth to no more than 20cm to reduce arrhythmia risk (15cm to 20cm is reasonable especially if LIJ or femoral). Each hash mark is 10cm, for instance \"do not progress the guidewire beyond two hashmarks\" Once a guidewire is intravascular, always ensure someone is holding onto it; there is a risk of accidentally pushing it in / pulling it out during preparations for next steps Prior to dilating, confirm wire is in target vein with ultrasound (in short and long axis). Long axis might show through-and-through, distal to site of wire entry Always ensure target for venous cannulation is visualized and guidewire is placed correctly prior to dilation: Compression of target vessel Non-pulsatile dark blood return (but be cognizant this is unreliable in patients in shock) US visualization of needle and wire Can use pressure tubing or the empty guidewire sheath or angiocath to confirm CVP (check if blood continuously rises against gravity and/or is pulsatile in tubing) or obtain venous O2 sat See Youtube video above for complete steps of procedure Post-procedural Considerations Every IJ or subclavian central line needs a confirmation CXR to confirm no PTX Ideal placement of distal tip: in SVC just outside the right atrium, approximately near/superior to carina and right tracheobronchial angle For dialysis access, tip at the CA junction is favored for highest flow rate Troubleshooting Complications Arterial Access or puncture: immediately remove needle and hold pressure for 15 mins to prevent hematoma formation (US can be used to detect persistent hemorrhage); if uncontrolled bleeding or artery was dilated, STAT vascular surgery consult Bleeding: place direct pressure; subclavian access precludes ability to compress and confers highest bleeding risk; if uncontrolled, STAT vascular surgery consult Pulmonary Complications: if free air aspirated into syringe, consider PTX vs poor seal of syringe & needle. STAT CXR. If rapid deterioration, needle decompression and chest tube placement required. Venous air embolism: Can occur if air introduced to system during placement, flushing, or if left open to the atmosphere. If suspected, place pt in left lateral decubitus position to trap air in right apex and place pt on 100% O2 to speed resorption Arrhythmia: rationale for telemetry monitoring as guidewire can lead to atrial or ventricular arrhythmias; immediately withdraw wire to lesser depth; if arrythmia persists, abort procedure and treat patient and determine cause Resistance to guidewire/dilator: it is not unusual to experience mild resistance during guidewire insertion, especially as more length is introduced or the needle was introduced too perpendicular to skin; but firm resistance is concerning for not being endovenous, stenosis, or thrombus. consider retracting and reintroducing; or abort and try again with finder needle to ensure correct site insertion; never forcefully advance wire or dilator Lumbar Puncture NEJM video guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnH9gECy_wU Indications Diagnosis of suspected CNS infections, CNS malignancies, demyelinating diseases, IIH, NPH, autoimmune encephalitis, suspected SAH with negative imaging Administration of medications intrathecally, including anesthetics and chemotherapy agents Absolute Contraindications Increased intracranial pressure with risk of herniation (e.g. space-occupying lesions, cerebral edema, obstructive hydrocephalus), infection or epidural abscess over puncture site, trauma to lumbar vertebrae Relative Contraindications Increased intracranial pressure, thrombocytopenia, bleeding diatheses, Coagulopathies, prior lumbar surgery Consent Common risks: back pain (~66%), severe headache Rare risks: spinal hematoma (<0.001%), weakness, radicular pain/numbness, bleeding, brain function problems, CNS infection, brain herniation Pre-procedural Considerations Bleeding risk guidelines: Plts > 50k, INR < 1.6 (stricter guidelines d/t spinal hematoma risk) CT head not generally needed prior to LP to rule out mass lesion; consider if presence of focal neurologic signs, papilledema, recent seizure, or immunocompromise Consider sending to fluoro-guided if: attempts without imaging are unsuccessful, obese patients with no palpable anatomy, severe scoliosis, prior spine surgery, borderline low plts and multiple sticks might be needed, or patient requires heavy sedation Labs: cell count w/diff, BF culture, glucose, protein; freeze sample for future/additional labs (order in Epic); if infectious or neurological labs are needed, consider consult first Ensure lateral decubitus position for opening pressure with glass pressure manometer Supplies Lumbar puncture kit Skin prep Drapes 20- or 22-gauge needle for lidocaine administration Collection tubes Manometer Spinal needle of 20 or 22 gauge Sterile gloves Hair covering, eye protection (especially if high OP anticipated or done with patient in sitting position), and mask Anesthetic use: Lidocaine 1-2% (likely need more than what is provided in kit) Table Chlorhexidine x3 Always prepare 1 or 2 backup 20g LP needles (yellow cap) In case of occlusion by superficial bleeding The LP needle in the kit are too long, unwieldy Consider sterile towels or even a Safe-T centesis kit because the drape in the LP kits have become increasingly poor quality (no adhesive, doesn't stick to patient; just thin paper) Procedural Considerations US Probe: linear (can use curvilinear in obese patients) in transverse axis to establish midline and in sagittal axis to identify spinous processes Anesthetic use: lidocaine 1-2% (likely need more than what is provided in kit; consider empiric anesthetization of 2 spaces \u00b1 Pain-Ease spray) Higher rate of success if stylet is removed before entering subarachnoid space to better observe flow of CSF once in the subarachnoid space. Stylet should be replaced prior to LP needle removal Ensure lateral decubitus position, if opening pressure (OP) via manometry is desired If OP is not necessary, sitting position greatly increases success Normal opening pressure ranges from 7 to 18cmH2O (manometer goes up to 35; it is not commonplace to use the plastic extender) See video above for details on identifying correct target and procedural steps A common occurrence is patient report of leg pain; this implies needle has travelled too laterally; consider redirecting needle towards midline in the contralateral direction to the affected leg (if tingling down R leg, go L) Aspiration of CSF = increased risk of bleeding. Don't aspirate! Volume removal for studies: Basic only: 2mL per tube in 1-4 Many studies ordered: 3mL per tube (*consider calling lab to confirm) Cytology desired: call lab to confirm amount needed (rule of thumb 2/2/6/2mL) Tube 4 is sent for micro to reduce contamination Therapeutic high volume: 30mL max; therapeutic LP is typically done by consultants, with CSF removal until one of two end points are reached; either closing pressure <20 and/or 35ml of removal (neurology restricts to 50ml) Post-procedural Considerations Post-LP headache (~10%): encourage patient to lay flat to reduce the intensity of symptoms (but does not prevent it); if prolonged, consider blood patch (consult Anesthesia) Neuro changes OR bleeding complications: STAT non-contrast MRI lumbar spine for epidural hematoma, consult Neurosurgery, q1 neuro-checks x4hrs then q2 for 24-48hr Resuming anticoagulation: 1h UFH, 4h LMWH, 6-8h rivaroxaban/apixaban, 6h dabigatran/fondaparinux. Longer periods should be considered after traumatic tap, and post-procedure monitoring of neurological function is recommended for all patients Dobhoff Tube Indications Enteral feeding and medication administration if unable to swallow DHT vs. NGT: DHT deliver meds and fluids, NGT provide suction to decompress (can also deliver meds/fluids); nurses place NGT, residents (and ICU nurses) place DHT Relative Contraindications Esophageal varices or strictures (most hepatologists say this is not a contra-indication, but discuss if recent bleed or recent banding) Other altered gastric anatomy that may prevent passage (e.g. gastric bypass, esophageal hernias, tumors or other possible obstructions) SBO or ileus (use NGT instead for suction) Hx of major epistaxis Absolute Contraindications for Blind Approach Facial trauma, basilar skull fracture, pharyngeal or esophageal trauma Consent Common risks: malposition (lung \u2192 PTX or PNA; pyriform sinus; coiling anywhere along tract), perforation anywhere along the tract, aspiration, nasal ulceration, esophagitis, gastritis, bleeding, vagal response, discomfort Verbal Consent is adequate; no form on Medex Supplies DHT kit (make sure it isn't the CORTRACK kit; long yellow sensor wire) Bridle Straw and cup of water (if safe to use from aspiration perspective) Lidocaine jelly Scissors (suture removal kit) 10ml syringe (if planning air insufflation) Also consider: Box of tissues Emesis bag Plastic bin to carry supplies to bedside Pre-procedural Considerations Bleeding risk guidelines: Plts > 10k, no specific INR guidelines Make sure DHT and bridle sizes correlate Determine whether a patient needs DHT or NG For patient comfort preferred sizes for DHT is 8F or 10F (if at risk for occlusion, or planning to discharge home with tube), NG is 14F Measure expected advancement depth by measuring distance from tip of nose, around ear, and to xiphoid process Prior to placement, fasten the stylet in the fully-hubbed position to reduce bending and folding over of the weighted tip while advancing Apply anesthetic with lidocaine gel (order Lidocaine uro-jet) and nasal swab to reduce patient discomfort, reduce gag reflex, and assist with clearance of the nasal passages Consider fluoro-guided placement after 3 failed bedside attempts Post-pyloric Placement Consider in patients with high pulmonary aspiration risk, severe esophageal reflux/esophagitis, recurrent emesis, impaired gastric mobility, and pancreatitis Refer for fluoro-guided post-pyloric advancement after 1 failed bedside attempt Procedural Considerations Have the patient sit upright with their head tilted toward the chest Tip: advance horizontally (nose tip to ear lobe), not angled up If patient can participate safely, have the patient swallow in conjunction with advancement Excessive coughing, difficulty phonating, or resistance may indicate tracheal placement. Withdraw tube and re-attempt. Consider Duonebs to reduce bronchospasms Post-pyloric placement has been shown to be up to 90% successful with intermittent insufflation of 10-20cc of air ~every 10cm of advancement after 55cm to promote pylorus opening. IV Reglan or erythromycin may also help When placing bridle (recommend AFTER xray confirmation), keep alignment markers (marked on both probes) together so magnetic tips will align once past the nasal septum When placing the bridle, remove the green stylet housed within the white probe before retracting back and removing the white probe Post-procedural Considerations ALWAYS confirm position with KUB before medications are given Insufflation of air and auscultation of bowel sounds over the gastric area can be reassuring of correct placement of DHT prior to taping/bridling and leaving the bedside Most mispositioned/coiled tubes have to be removed and re-attempted, but it is ok to advance or withdraw if the stylet is still in place. However, once removed, a stylet should not be re-introduced to a mispositioned/coiled tube due to risk of GI perforation In case of cranial placement, don't remove, consult Neurosurgery De-clogging: Clog Zapper Kit (can type this into Epic directly); Coca cola Paracentesis Video Guides VUMC Procedure Service video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQSsb9705LE&t=160s NEJM video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVpwXK7cvzQ Indications Diagnostic: evaluation of new onset ascites or of known ascites with concern for SBP. There is benefit to all patients with ascites receiving diagnostic paracentesis on admission to the hospital. Therapeutic: tense ascites, refractory to diuretics, causing patient discomfort Relative Contraindications Significant bowel distension due to ileus or SBO, hemodynamic instability (due to large fluid shifts with LVP), DIC, infection/breakdown of skin overlying puncture site Consent Risks: abdominal wall hematoma (1%), hemoperitoneum, organ puncture / bowel perforation, infection, ascitic fluid leak Pre-procedural Considerations Bleeding risk guidelines: Plts > 20k, INR < 4 (cirrhosis complicates INR interpretation) Number of bottles (can call the service center to request) Labs: cell count w/diff, BF culture, BF and serum albumin, total protein; cytology if concerned for malignancy; BF/serum Hct if bloody Measure skin/subQ depth with US to help choose sufficiently long needle Supplies For both diagnostic & therapeutic para, would recommend using the kits (obviously don't use the catheter for diagnostic; just the supplies); it has everything you need in one place; not really saving hospital any money getting supplies separately versus just using a kit Ultrasound with curvilinear probe Sterile gloves Bouffant or surgical cap, surgical mask Pen to mark entry point Chlorhexidine Lidocaine/epi if high bleeding risk Lab recommends only blood in culture bottles Specimen cup Vacuum bottles or wall suction canisters (if LVP, ask nurse to call down to service center for 3L canisters; rather than the 1L ones typically stocked by floors for oral wall suction) Table 6 Fr Safe-T-Centesis Kit - Note that the 6F kit is preferred over the 8F as it has the blunt tip safety mechanism Procedural Considerations Ultrasound Probe: curvilinear Identify safe pocket (>2 cm deep), with no nearby bowel or adhesions. Avoid surgical scars. Attempt as lateral as possible to avoid inferior epigastric vessels. Local anesthesia with lidocaine all the way to peritoneum, as this is most sensitive part Kit: 6 Fr Safe-T-Centesis Kit; gather cx bottles, cx bottle syringe adaptor, specimen cup If only diagnostic, use 18G needle with 20-50cc syringe rather than kit If high bleeding risk, use long 18G needle & attach to syringe instead of 6 Fr. Catheter If hernia present, have the patient reduce it while draining fluid to prevent incarceration Inoculate culture bottles at bedside rather than sending fluid samples to lab for inoculation to increase yield 50% \u2192 80% (Note that VA does not allow bedside inoculation.) Post-procedural Considerations Albumin (25%) for large volume (>5L) removal: 8 g per liter removed, up to 50 g Ascitic leak: can try skin glue or place 1 figure-of-eight stitch with 4.0 vicryl Bleeding: Hold pressure with quick-clot and gauze for >5-10 mins for persistent bleeding. STAT page EGS or IR if profuse bleeding or concern for organ injury Thoracentesis NEJM Video Guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivTyH09BcHg Indications New pleural effusion that has no obvious explanation (not attributed to HF alone) or concern for pleural space infection Any respiratory symptoms that would positively respond to large volume thoracentesis (>1L) Contraindications Skin infection at needle insertion site Large-volume thoracentesis in hepatic hydrothorax (tends to reaccumulate). Suspected unexpandable lung Consent Common risks (> 5%): coughing, fainting, pneumothorax (PTX) Rare risks (< 1%): hemothorax, re-expansion pulmonary edema, liver/spleen puncture Pre-procedural Considerations Bleeding risk guidelines: Plts > 50k, INR < 2 (risk/benefit evaluation outside these) Identify safe pocket (>2 cm) between lung and diaphragm (ask Pulmonary or Interventional Radiology if sample is needed of a smaller pocket) If loculations present on US, high risk, or any question about indication, consult Pulm Labs: cell count w/diff; BF culture; BF and serum LDH, total protein, and Hct (if bloody); cytology if concerned for malignancy; consider triglycerides for chylothorax Supplies Table, pillow for patient to rest arms on US Probe: Curvilinear/abdominal probe Sterile gloves Bouffant or surgical cap, surgical mask Chlorhexidine wipes x3 50ml syringe (often not included in kits) Marking pen Kit: 6Fr Safe-T-Centesis kit Chlorhexidine Drape Lidocaine 10mL syringe and 22G or 25G needle for lidocaine administration 16G needle to connect tubing to vacuum bottles for fluid collection Sterile drainage tubing 2L specimen bag 8mL vials x3 Bandaid If you don't intend to use the included 2L specimen bag (such as for non-diagnostic, large volume thoracentesis), prepare vacuum bottles 8F kit is not advised; not only does it lack the safety tip mechanism, it can be too large to negotiate intercostal spaces in some small / elderly patients Procedural Considerations US Probe: cardiac (or linear) to identify safe pocket (>2 cm) between lung and diaphragm Ask Interventional Pulm or IR if sample is needed of a smaller pocket Kit: 6Fr Safe-T-Centesis kit Upright position is typically preferred; lateral to mid-scap/mid-ax. If patient unable to sit upright, refer to Procedure Team or Pulmonology Effusion size: if unable to tap above 9th rib, too small; CXR with costophrenic angle blunting should correlate to ~250-500mL Insert needle superior to rib to avoid neurovascular bundle (bundles run below) Stop if patient has any new/increased chest discomfort, aggressive unremitting cough, frank purulence or air on aspiration, lightheadedness, hypotension, or vagal response Stop fluid removal after 1.5 L of chronic pleural effusion to reduce re-expansion pulmonary edema Post-procedural Considerations If needing cytology, send at least 60 \u2013 100cc Bleeding complication: STAT page Thoracic Surgery PTX: If stable and asymptomatic, supplemental O2 and repeat CXR in 4hrs. If unstable or symptomatic, STAT page to Thoracic Surgery Re-expansion pulmonary edema: Persistent cough, frothy sputum. Diffuse GGO on side of thoracentesis. Supportive management (oxygen, monitor); most resolve in 24-48 hrs. If respiratory distress progresses, may need mechanical ventilation Documentation: effusion US characteristics (anechoic, layering debris, septations), reason for ending procedure (stopped early due to chest discomfort, complication vs tapped dry), presence of lung sliding, if more than scant residual effusion remains post-procedure A CXR after thoracentesis is no longer indicated for most asymptomatic, non-ventilated patients. Check lung slide with US in 2D and M-mode US-Guided PIV VUMC video Guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQGhciB6TvM Indications Vascular access; large bore (16-18G) is optimal for blood transfusion and faster than central lines (except MAC/Cordis); preserves central access (important for ESRD patients) Relative Contraindications Infection over the site, severe bleeding diathesis Avoid EJs unless have been trained due to airway compromise if extravasation occurs Consent Risks: arterial puncture, nerve irritation/damage, infection, infiltration, thrombus formation Pre-procedural Considerations Bleeding risk guidelines: Plts > 10k, no specific INR guidelines Location selection: anuric AKI or ESRD\u2013discuss with Nephrology, avoid limb with HD access Target selection: Confirm venous choice with compressibility and lack of doppler flow. Should follow the rule of 2s: vein must be at least twice the diameter of the catheter being placed, should be no more than 2 inches in depth from the surface of the skin, and should have at least 2 inches of straight (non-tortuous) length Supplies Ultrasound with linear probe Needle, preferably 18G or 20G ultrasound specific needles Longer catheter if needed; but note, using the longer catheter in a non-obese patient can make procedure more difficult (have to insert more catheter) and cause kink (excessive length can takes it to next vascular bifurcation point) Kit This will typically include gauze, tourniquet, tubing, and dressing Chlorhexidine prep Saline flushes Procedural Considerations US Probe: Linear Kit: IV start kit; ideally 18G needle Anesthetic use: Consider EMLA 1st choice: basilic, cephalic veins; 2nd choice: brachial vein (caution adjacent artery) Hold probe close to skin, holding probe far from the end allows too much movement Start at 45\u00b0 angle, use 45-45-90 rule to determine starting location (start as far from center of probe as the vessel is deep). Flatten angle once in the vessel to advance (\"walk\" your way through the vessel by repeatedly identifying needle tip in the lumen and advancing) Going too shallow could use up too much catheter leaving nothing to put in the vein Going too steep can cause catheter kinking at the hub where it sticks out of the skin Use both short axis and long axis views to ensure correct placement Short axis: vessel looks round like a target, helps to scout out the tip, and is best for ensuring the vein is entered as opposed to a neighboring artery Long axis: intended for the final few mm of catheter advancement into the vein to ensure both bevel and plastic sheath lumen traverse the endothelial layer before threading catheter Post-procedural Considerations Don't forget to remove tourniquet. Remove before flushing to prevent blowing vein Bleeding complication: if arterial, remove catheter and hold pressure at least 5 mins Post-Procedural Care Author: Terra Swanson Liver Biopsy Percutaneous Liver Bx (transabdominal approach) Patient have some abdominal pain that day and/or referred pain to the shoulder. Should improve by next day. Treat with pain medicine PRN. Avoid Toradol. Main risk is bleeding/hemoperitoneum. No routine follow up labs unless clinical concern for bleeding. If concerned, order stat H/H, call IR to discuss whether a triple phase CTA abdomen (noncontrast, arterial and venous phases) is warranted to look for active bleeding. Wound care: will just have a bandaid, can come off in 24 hrs Transjugular Liver Bx (Neck, right internal jugular approach) Monitor right neck access for signs of hematoma. Transjugular biopsies have lower risk of bleeding but still possible, follow recommendations as above if clinical concern. No routine labs. If gauze/Tegaderm present, this can be removed after 24 hrs and replaced with another bandage until skin nick heals. If dermabond present, leave intact and advise patient to not remove dermabond (it will fall off on its own). TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) Please ensure hepatology consult if not admitted to hepatology service after primary TIPS placement. Typically right IJ small incision access. Monitor for hematoma Patients often get a paracentesis intra-op if ascites is present, typically get albumin intra-op if >5L were drained Main Post Op Concerns Abdominal and/or neck pain to be expected post-TIPS. Monitor for increasing abdominal distention or neck hematoma. Hypotension can occur s/p TIPS. Consider albumin and IVF. If vitals not responding, obtain H/H and trend, touch base with IR to evaluate for risk of bleeding. If CT is warranted to eval for active bleeding: order a triple phase CTA abdomen/pelvis (noncontrast, arterial and venous phases). Monitor for signs of HE (hepatic encephalopathy) as more blood is being diverted away from liver and thus not being properly cleared of toxins. Patient may need to initiate lactulose if HE develops Monitor for signs heart failure after TIPS, usually they have a pre-op echo to assess for risk Routine post-op LFTS typically not necessary as LFTs expected to be elevated immediately after TIPS, unless there is another clinical indication to check them. Most patients can be discharged POD1 if no issues. Patient will have follow-up coordinated in IR at 1 month with a follow-up TIPS ultrasound around that time. Patient should also have follow-up with their hepatologist. Post Renal Biopsy Monitoring and Complications (VUMC & VA) Routine Monitoring All patients are observed overnight in the hospital Strict bed rest for 8 hrs following procedure followed by bed rest with bathroom privileges Transplant bx: an abd binder with tennis ball is placed for 10 minutes post biopsy (NOTE: this must be removed promptly to avoid compression injury/ATN) Frequent vital signs (q15 min x 4, q30 min x 4, q1h x 4, then q4h) You must inform the VA resident and preferentially the nurse at the VA who will be caring for your patient of these orders. Serial hct evaluation (at 0h, 4h, 8-12h, 18-24h) Serial urine collection x 3 (to assess for gross hematuria) Do NOT give SQ heparin (i.e., DVT prophylaxis), anti-platelet agents, or anticoagulating agents for 2 weeks post biopsy. If patient develops life threatening illness requiring anticoagulation (e.g., ACS, DVT, PE) during this period, the renal fellow and attending should be notified immediately. Clinical Signs and Symptoms of Post-biopsy Complication SBP <100, HR >120 or worsening hypertension from Page Kidney Gross hematuria Moderate or severe pain at biopsy site New onset of abd pain or loin pain Evidence of bleeding (decrease in hct, increase in abd girth, abd/back ecchymosis) Management of Complications Bed rest Pain control Fluid resuscitation (for gross hematuria, \"clot colic\") Maintenance of normal coagulation Imaging (renal ultrasound or CT scan of abd/pelvis) CT scan with contrast is better for visualizing extravasation. Discuss imaging type with your attending and maybe IR/Trauma. Transfusion of blood products Coil embolization by IR Surgical exploration or nephrectomy Protocol for Management of Post Biopsy Complications Renal fellow on call should be notified with a decrease in hct >3% pts, new or severe pain, significant hemodynamic changes (tachycardia or low or high blood pressure), or with any other significant post bx complication. The renal fellow or attending should help coordinate all consults and/or transfers. Remember that if there is an acute bleed the hematocrit may be unchanged. In this setting tachycardia and blood pressure will be the first sign of a bleed. Ensure type and screen current; have cross matched blood available (if necessary); obtain serial hct checks and check frequent vital signs. If appropriate, transfer patient to unit with higher level of care. Patients with significant bleeding should be transferred to the Trauma ICU for management of penetrating renal trauma. Consultation of Interventional Radiology, Trauma Surgery, or Transplant surgery (for transplant biopsies) should be considered. Nephrology (or Transplant Nephrology) attending on call and attending who performed biopsy should be notified of any complications immediately!

Patient may need to initiate lactulose if HE develops Monitor for signs heart failure after TIPS, usually they have a pre-op echo to assess for risk Routine post-op LFTS typically not necessary as LFTs expected to be elevated immediately after TIPS, unless there is another clinical indication to check them. Most patients can be discharged POD1 if no issues. Patient will have follow-up coordinated in IR at 1 month with a follow-up TIPS ultrasound around that time. Patient should also have follow-up with their hepatologist.","title":"Main Post Op Concerns"},{"location":"Procedures/#post-renal-biopsy-monitoring-and-complications-vumc-va","text":"","title":"Post Renal Biopsy Monitoring and Complications (VUMC &amp; VA)"},{"location":"Procedures/#routine-monitoring","text":"All patients are observed overnight in the hospital Strict bed rest for 8 hrs following procedure followed by bed rest with bathroom privileges Transplant bx: an abd binder with tennis ball is placed for 10 minutes post biopsy (NOTE: this must be removed promptly to avoid compression injury/ATN) Frequent vital signs (q15 min x 4, q30 min x 4, q1h x 4, then q4h) You must inform the VA resident and preferentially the nurse at the VA who will be caring for your patient of these orders.

Aggression is a specific form of agitation in which the person is threatening or attempting to harm another person or physical objects. Agitation is a broader term which may also include irritability, anxiety, pacing, yelling, sexually inappropriate behavior, pulling at restraints or medical devices, among others. Presentation Impulsive Aggression Spontaneous, explosive, reactive/reflexive, not pre-meditated - Delirium, psychosis, cognitive deficits, withdrawal/intoxication, pain, post-ictal Instrumental Aggression Pre-meditated, controlled, purposeful behaviors - Personality disorders, secondary gain, delusional thought Differential Diagnosis for Aggression Personality disorder: antisocial, borderline, paranoid, narcissistic, attempts to manipulate staff or situation Delirium Dementia Psychoses: mania, depression, schizophrenia, delusional disorder Substance use disorder: both intoxication and withdrawal states from alcohol, PCP, stimulants, cocaine, synthetics Frontal lobe syndromes (TBI, CVA, neoplasm, neurodegenerative process) Behavior/Developmental: Intermittent explosive disorder, intellectual disability including autism spectrum disorder Evaluation Examine (when calm) for source of pain, signs of infection, discomfort (ex: urinary retention or constipation), toxidromes Neurological exam for focal deficits, ataxia, nystagmus, tremor, rigidity, aphasias Review medication list and perform med reconciliation of home meds Recent medication changes including recently started medications and home medications that have been held or recently discontinued UDS + review of CSMD for evaluation of intoxication/withdrawal Keep in mind limitations of sensitivity and specificity of immunoassay trained against specific epitopes Opiate antibodies commonly have codeine and morphine as their target analytes and will not detect fentanyl and many other synthetic or semisynthetic opioids that are structurally distinct from morphine Benzodiazepines antibodies commonly have oxazepam (diazepam and chlordiazepoxide metabolite) as a target analyte with poor cross sensitivity to lorazepam and clonazepam Amphetamines broadly includes commonly prescribed stimulants used to treat ADHD as well as methamphetamine CBC, CMP, UA CT head + EEG if focal neurologic deficits For evaluation of AMS, typically order only non-contrasted CTH, may follow up with contrasted MRI Management Environment Periodic room searches; search or remove personal belongings, VUPD presence if warranted Virtual or 1:1 sitter placement; unit can obtain CSO sitter for high risk patients Delirium precautions (see delirium section) Disposable trays and utensils (minimize potential weapons in the room) Medication Reconciliation Reduce or eliminate total anticholinergic load and other deliriogenic medications (see delirium) De-escalation Always first line and best if attempted early when patient is anxious or irritable, although impractical if patient is unable to communicate effectively, is explosive or already engaging in violent/potentially harmful behavior Nonverbal: - Keep yourself between the patient and the door to allow exit if needed - Maintain safe distance, avoid sudden movements, don't touch the patient - Maintain neutral posture, sincere eye contact Verbal: - Speak in calm, clear tone, avoid confrontation, and offer to solve problem if possible - Do not insist on having the last word and try to not take provocations personally - See MI section on \"OARS\" for strategies - Redirection: Acknowledge patient's frustrations (\"OARS\" as above); shift focus on how to solve the problem - Aligning goals: Emphasize common ground and big picture; make small concessions; what can you and the patient agree on? Restraints Should be used only when necessary to protect patient or others from harm Mechanically restrained patients cannot be left unmonitored and must have a virtual or in person sitter ordered De-escalate (4 point to 2 point, etc.) and remove restraints as soon as possible Documentation of restraint: - Face-to-face assessment has to be completed within an hour of violent restraint - \"Restraint Charting\" tab \u2013 typically in rarely used tab drop down Mechanical Restraints: - Soft restraints (non-violent) \u2013 most commonly used - Hard restraints (violent) \u2013 reserved for severe behavioral health (only 2 sets in house) - Mittens - Posey Vest \u2013 prevents exiting bed, allows limbs to be free, can be attached to bedside recliners - Posey Bed \u2013 wandering patient (TBI, severe dementia) VUMC Orders: \"restraint\" \u2192 order set - Non-violent non-self-destructive (order lasts up to 48 hrs.) - Most patients needing restraint: non-psychiatric, delirium, dementia, intubation - Violent self-destructive adult - Order lasts up to 24hr with assessment every 4 hours - Mainly severe psychiatric symptoms Pharmacological Management for Agitation As discussed above, behavioral interventions are first line for agitation management in the hospital. Pharmacologic treatment should only be used when needed for patient and/or staff safety when non-pharmacologic interventions are unsuccessful or impractical. Not all forms of agitation can be treated pharmacologically, but all forms of aggression toward staff need to be addressed immediately. Acute Agitation Antipsychotics Widely effective for acute agitation, especially in delirium and psychotic disorders Monitor EKG if repeated dosing or if used with other QT prolonging agents Use QTcF and not QTcB Estimated QTc on standard EKGs is commonly QTcB (QT/RR^1/2) and is artificially increased in the setting of tachycardia and overestimates the number of patients with a potentially dangerous QTc prolongation Bradycardia is a significant risk factor for TdP Tachycardia is somewhat protective from TdP Moderate agitation options: - Olanzapine 2.5 - 5mg po q6h prn. Orally disintegrating tab (ODT) available - Quetiapine 12.5 - 25mg q6h po prn for patients at higher risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) Severe agitation: - Haloperidol 0.5 - 1mg IV/IM q6h prn for older/frail individuals - Haloperidol 2-3mg IV/IM q6h prn for other patients - Titrate up to 5-10 mg and can increase frequency as warranted - When using IV haloperidol obtain daily EKG, Mg and K levels should be kept above 2 and 4, respectively - Stop IV haloperidol if QTcF > 500 msec Benzodiazepines Lacks EPS that can occur with antipsychotics but can worsen delirium & disinhibit patients with neurocognitive-related agitation First choice for agitation without clear etiology or in patients with severe aggression Can use alone or in addition to antipsychotic agent Preferred for agitation related to intoxication/withdrawal of sedatives Lorazepam preferentially used due to PO, IV and IM availability Lorazepam 2mg PO/IM/IV q6h prn typical starting dose (1mg if older/frail) Can increase frequency if warranted. Monitor for respiratory suppression If severe agitation not responsive to above, may require ICU admission and sedation: - Dexmedetomidine (preferred), propofol or midazolam Maintenance Medications Antipsychotics - Reserve scheduled antipsychotics for aggression that poses significant risk and aim to wean as soon as safely possible - Adverse effects: metabolic, EPS, increased mortality in dementia - Most commonly used: olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone Antiepileptic Agents - May be effective in reduction of impulsive aggression in TBI or dementia - Most commonly used: Valproate - Levetiracetam could worsen aggression/agitation Beta Blockers and Alpha Agonists - Noradrenergic over-activity implicated in aggression expression (think adrenaline spike + confusion) - Commonly Used: propranolol, clonidine, guanfacine Serotonergic Agents: SSRI/SNRI/buspirone - Useful if co-occurring depression/anxiety disorders - Peak onset of action takes weeks Delirium Author: Ben Johnson Background Definition: acute (hours to days) fluctuating disturbance of attention and awareness due to an underlying medical condition Complex and multifactorial condition, often due to underlying condition, with unknown pathophysiological mechanisms Increased morbidity, mortality, and functional decline Presentation: deficits in attention, orientation, or memory; hallucinations or delusions; sleep-wake disturbances; psychomotor changes (hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed); language impairment; anxious or depressed mood, and/or emotional lability (agitation) Think about the ABC's of Delirium: Affect (anxiety, paranoia, irritability, apathy, mood shifts, personality changes) Behavior (hallucinations, restlessness or agitation, psychomotor abnormalities, sleep disturbances) Cognition (impaired memory, disorientation, disturbances in speech) Delirium can persist despite identification and reversal of underlying causes, particularly in older patients or those with baseline cognitive deficits. Evaluation Use screening tools to assess for delirium: Brief Confusion Assessment Method (bCAM) . See critical care section for the ICU version, CAM-ICU. Brief Confusion Assessment Method (bCAM) Flow Sheet (adapted, see physical handbook for full flowsheet) Feature 1 - Altered Mental Status or Fluctuating Course - If No \u2192 bCAM Negative, No Delirium - If Yes \u2192 proceed to Feature 2 Feature 2 - Inattention \"Can you name the months backwards from December to July?\" - If 0 or 1 errors \u2192 bCAM Negative, No Delirium - If > 1 errors \u2192 proceed to Feature 3 Feature 3 - Altered Level of Consciousness? Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale - If Yes \u2192 bCAM POSITIVE, DELIRIUM PRESENT - If No \u2192 proceed to Feature 4 Feature 4 - Disorganized Thinking 1) Will a stone float on water? 2) Are there fish in the sea? 3) Does one pound weigh more than two pounds? 4) Can you use a hammer to pound a nail? Command: \"Hold up this many fingers\" (Hold up two fingers). \"Now do the same thing with the other hand\" (Do not demonstrate). - If No Errors \u2192 bCAM Negative, No Delirium - If Any Errors \u2192 bCAM POSITIVE, DELIRIUM PRESENT Once delirium is diagnosed, evaluate for the underlying cause. Delirium has many etiologies and may occur alone or in combination (in ~10% of cases, no clear cause is found) Mnemonic for Common Causes of Delirium: DELIRIUM D - Drugs/toxins (use of benzodiazepines, opiates, anticholinergics, steroids, etc., withdrawal from ETOH, benzos, etc.) E - Eyes/ears (sensory deficits) L - Low perfusion states (MI, PE, heart failure, sepsis) I - Infection R - Retention (urine, stool) I - Intracranial events (trauma, seizure, stroke, hemorrhage) U - Undernutrition/dehydration M - Metabolic, endocrine (Hypo or hyper Na, hyperCa, uremia, thyroid, hypoglycemia) Workup History - Review current medications including those recently started or discontinued, as well as drug interactions - Review alcohol, sedative, substance use - Assess for pain and discomfort Vital signs - Temperature, O2 sat, POC glucose, and orthostatic vitals Physical exam - Assess for infection (SSTI, UTI, pneumonia, meningitis), abdominal pain, and sensory impairments, FND Labs - CMP - Renal and hepatic function for changes in metabolism/elimination of medications - Glucose - Ammonia - Serum medication levels - Magnesium - TSH and free thyroxine - Infection \u2013 U/A, CXR, blood, urine, and sputum cultures - CBC - B12, folate, vit D Imaging - CTH \u2013 non-contrast unless unable to get MRI (stroke, large structural changes) - MRIb with contrast (stroke, infection, inflammation, more subtle structural changes) Medications - review anticholinergics, sedatives, opioids - Are changes needed to address pain control, constipation, insomnia, nausea, etc? Substance use \u2013 evaluate for EtOH or BZD withdrawal state - Empirically load on thiamine (500mg IV tid x9 doses) EEG \u2013 evaluate for seizures, confirm presence of encephalopathic changes LP \u2013 if concerned for CNS infection, inflammatory condition Management Treat underlying cause as above Cognitive impairment or disorientation Provide clock, calendar, and appropriate lighting Regular reorientation Provide cues from a familiar environment (pictures, calls or visits from family members) Ensure hearing aids, glasses, and dentures are available Maintain normal sleep-wake cycle Keep lights on in the day and avoid excessive naps Early PT, OT interventions, mobilization, move to bedside chair when able Remove medical support devices as able (foley catheters, restraints, telemetry) Ensure adequate bowel regimen and hydration Assess for pain and treat appropriately Medication reconciliation to reduce or eliminate total anticholinergic load, and to reduce or eliminate other deliriogenic medications as able See Beers criteria See critical care section for prevention in the ICU (ABCDEF bundle) Note on pharmacologic management: There is no pharmacologic intervention known to prevent or treat delirium. Medications for agitation only treat certain behavioral symptoms of delirium, are typically ineffective/harmful for hypoactive delirium, and do not modify the underlying pathological process. Reserve medications for agitation impairing patient safety when non-pharmacologic interventions alone are unsuccessful. See agitation section for medication approach. Inpatient Insomnia Author: Ben Johnson Background Sleep disturbances in the hospital are multifactorial Consequences of sleep disturbances include changes in cognition, behavior, anxiety, pain perception, respiratory function, inflammation, and metabolism Management Non-pharmacologic Interventions (when medically appropriate) Minimize: - Potential for overnight alarms (telemetry etc.) - Overnight vital signs - Overnight and early morning lab draws - Overnight IV fluids and late-night diuretics Discourage daytime naps - Administer nighttime medications earlier in the evening - Turn off or mute the television - Close room doors - Encourage care team to be as quiet as possible overnight - Keep lights on during the day and off at night - Ensure patient has CPAP available if used at home Pharmacotherapy Background - The best first step is to minimize medications such as sedative-hypnotics, opioids, glucocorticoids, beta blockers, and certain antibiotics that disturb sleep architecture Medications Melatonin: 1-5 mg PO qhs First-line choice based on mild side-effect profile, low potential for drug-drug interactions, and improves circadian rhythms Dose 2-3hrs before bedtime Trazodone: 25-50 mg PO qhs (max 200 mg/day) Side effects: headache, dry mouth, and nausea Monitor for orthostasis and infrequent atrial arrhythmias; use lowest effective dose Mirtazapine: 7.5-15 mg PO qHS A primary alpha-2 antagonist with 5-HT2 and H1 antagonism Consider when insomnia appears to be related to primary depression Can increase appetite and cause weight gain Additional Information - Avoid the Following in the Inpatient Setting Benzodiazepines - Reduces sleep latency and increases total sleep time but avoided due to significant adverse effects: respiratory depression, cognitive decline, delirium, daytime sleepiness, and falls, particularly in hospitalized older adults Non-benzodiazepines benzodiazepine receptor agonists (e.g., zolpidem, eszopiclone/zopiclone, zaleplon) - Commonly used in the outpatient setting but associated with cognitive dysfunction, delirium, and falls in hospitalized patients Diphenhydramine - Trials evaluating its effectiveness as a sleep aid are limited and show mixed results - Many potential side effects that are enhanced in the inpatient setting: impaired cognition, anticholinergic effects (constipation, urinary retention) Medical Decision-Making Capacity Author: Laura Artim Background Capacity is a patient's ability to make a specific medical decision at a specific point in time and can be assessed by any physician Capacity is fluid and may change with the patient's mental status, medical state, and the specifics of the decision being presented. A person may have capacity to make one decision and not another Competency: \"global decision-making capacity\" or ability to make financial decisions, etc are legal determinations made by a judge Evaluation Four Key Components 1. Consistent Choice: patient must clearly indicate a consistent choice - \"Have you decided whether to follow the recommendation for the treatment?\" - \"Can you tell me what your decision is?\" 2. Understand: Patient must grasp the fundamental meaning of the information communicated by the medical team - \"Please tell me in your own words what you were told about: - The problem with (1) your health now and (2) the recommended treatment - The risks/benefits of (3) treatment, (4) alternative treatments and (5) no treatment\" 3. Appreciate: patient must appreciate the medical condition and likely consequences of treatment options - \"What is treatment likely to do for you?\" - \"What do you believe will happen if you're not treated\" - \"Why do you think this treatment was recommended?\" 4. Manipulate: patient must rationally manipulate relevant information - \"What makes the chosen option better than the alternative?\" - \"How did you decide to accept or reject the recommended treatment?\" Management If the patient does not have medical decision-making capacity: Identify and remedy cause of impairment if possible (if decision is non-urgent) Identify surrogate decision maker Documenting medical decision-making capacity: Use a dot phrase .Capacity that lists the four components and document your thought process citing evidence from your interview Medical and Psychiatric Holds Author: Laura Artim Background 6401 vs. 6404 \"6401\": process to detain someone who has a high likelihood of posing harm to themselves or others due to mental illness. Purpose is short-term detention until a prompt psychiatric assessment can be performed - One person completes this. Can be law enforcement officers, psychologists, independently-licensed physicians - Must document justification for why the hold is needed (progress note, assessment form, etc) \"6404\": 6404 = Certificate of Need. Legal document used for emergency involuntary psychiatric admission - Patient must have mental illness or serious emotional disturbance (excluding intellectual/developmental disabilities) and pose an immediate substantial likelihood of serious harm because of this based on a face-to-face assessment by a qualified psychiatric professional - Treatment must be necessary for symptom reduction and lack of treatment would lead to deterioration, with no less drastic alternative to inpatient hospitalization - Two certificates needed: the first to transport a patient to a psychiatric facility and the second for an involuntary admission - Two different qualified persons must each complete a form - Psychiatry residents can write these due to their special training licenses - Attending physicians may also complete these forms - Residents functioning under a training license are not able to complete 6404 holds No AMA Medical Hold: used when a patient does not have capacity to leave the hospital against medical advice due to a medical condition and needs to remain in the hospital. A 6401, nor 6404 should be completed. - Can be ordered by any physician Medical Hold Order Set VUH Specific Procedures A physical copy of the first 6404 is required to accompany the patient when they are transported to a psychiatric facility after medical discharge. The form is typically completed by the psychiatry team. Personality Disorders Authors: Laura Artim, reviewed by Jonathan Smith and Daniel Daunis Background Caring for patients with personality disorder symptoms can result in patient and provider frustration, delays in treatment and at times, sub-optimal care and AMA discharges An understanding of personality disorders can mitigate some of these barriers Can be helpful to maintain the perspective that these responses to stress initially developed in order to help the person survive difficult circumstances early in life How Do Personality Disorders Develop? Genetic/temperament component, early traumatizing and shaping experiences Development of maladaptive perceptions and responses to other individuals Pathological interaction styles and response to stressors (fear of abandonment, dependence, rejection) are developed and become self-fulfilling and re-enforced leading to pervasive interpersonal difficulties Many people with these maladaptive coping strategies improve greatly with time and development of more mature coping strategies. In the hospital, we are often seeing them at their most vulnerable/stressed and thus most severe. Presentation Borderline Personality Disorder Unstable and intense relationships; \"splitting\" between idealization and devaluation Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment Impulsivity: substance use, binge eating, reckless behavior Recurrent suicidal behavior or gestures Mood instability: quick onset and short-lived intense dysphoria, irritability, anxiety Difficulty controlling anger (displays of temper, aggression) In the hospital: - May be demanding, demeaning, overly-attached to specific care team members - May try to push boundaries, ask for care or accommodations outside of usual practice - May use threats to leave AMA, self-harm, or threaten others to achieve their goals Narcissistic Personality Disorder Grandiosity: exaggerates achievements and expects to be recognized as superior Preoccupied with unlimited power, success, brilliance Sense of entitlement: expects favorable treatment and compliance with expectations Exploits others and lacks empathy In the hospital: - May present as entitled, talkative, difficult to redirect, overly-focused on their specific needs/goals - May use either threats or praise as a means of manipulating care team members - May ask for special treatment, become easily angered, consider themselves as a \"VIP\" patient Antisocial Personality Disorder Failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behavior Deceitfulness, lying, conning others for personal profit or pleasure Impulsivity and reckless disregard for others Irritability, aggressiveness and lack of remorse In the hospital: - May be aggressive, threatening, deceitful to achieve their goals - High rates of comorbid substance use and episodes of malingering (and at the same time may have very poor overall health and high likelihood of true medical emergencies) - May split staff members, use charm/be overly accommodating of some staff while demeaning and angry with others simultaneously Management Guidelines for Managing Borderline Personality Inpatient In crisis, name dominant emotion, validate the experience, and offer a non-medication coping strategies (deep diaphragmatic breathing) or a break in interview to facilitate affect regulation \"I see you're angry, you want to go smoke and we're not letting you right now,\" etc. Direct, clear, unambiguous communication especially around the limits of care, boundaries of behavior, and consequences of not adhering to these expectation \"If you continue to scream and threaten staff, we wont be able to safely care for you and will need to move toward discharge\" Remain consistent in treatment planning across services; if possible, have one provider identified as point person Maintain clear, consistent and enforceable limits on disruptive/violent behavior For personality disorders in general, create a behavioral plan Outline the patient, as well as the team's, responsibilities and goals of care with identification of the concerning behavior and a firm plan for if the agreement is broken Ideally, the patient should sign this plan and consider it as a contract Dot Phrase/Sample: .IMBehavioralPlan (go to dot phrases under user Joseph Quintana) Adjust, add and remove content based on patient Behavioral Interventions Aim for consistency w/ providers & nursing; limit consultants to \u2193 splitting behaviors Acknowledge patient's grievance/frustrations and shift focus on how to solve the problem Align goals by emphasizing common ground and find ways to make small concessions Be aware of progress and know when to disengage (if behaviors are escalating) Monitor countertransference (the emotions the patient is eliciting in the provider): Irresponsible and child-like behavior may prompt the provider to become angry or act in ways to limit the patient's control in their care, further perpetuating the behavior Projective Identification \u2013 a coping strategy in which a person creates the circumstances for another person to take blame for a feeling or behavior \u2013 i.e. provoking and insulting a physician, eliciting a defensive response, then blaming the physician for the poor relationship Outpatient Management Gold standard = Psychotherapy - Dialectical Behavioral therapy, Cognitive behavioral therapy, Psychodynamic - If the patient is willing, SW should assist with establishing at discharge Pharmacotherapy: - Unclear benefit in pharmacological management of Personality Disorder - Treatment of comorbid psychiatric disorders if present would be most appropriate, keeping in mind that those with personality disorders may also develop superimposed disorders such as PTSD or depression Catatonia Authors: Ben Johnson, Laura Artim Background Catatonia is a psychomotor syndrome and is associated with both psychiatric and medical conditions Catatonia can present as hypoactive or hyperactive May be secondary to a medical or psychiatric condition Would recommend AMS workup as appropriate while awaiting psychiatric evaluation Severity can range from mild with subtle abnormalities to severe and possibly fatal Onset of catatonia can range from hours to days or weeks Episodes can be acute, chronic and persistent, or periodic and recurring Duration of catatonia related to intoxication or underlying medical conditions relate to the duration of the underlying cause Prevalence estimates vary widely due in large part to a variety of presentations and inconsistent diagnosis Estimates range from 10-30% Evaluation Presentations are often varied, so early psychiatric intervention is important given possibility of autonomic instability that can be fatal. If catatonia is considered on the differential, a psychiatric consultation is encouraged early-on. Catatonia can include quantitative changes in psychomotor activity and qualitatively bizarre behaviors Some clues may include increased muscle tone, decreased speech production, decreased PO intake, abnormal movements or behaviors that do not seem goal-oriented, maintaining odd postures, refusing to follow commands, repetitive movements such as pacing, repeating phrases, or grimacing Hypoactive catatonia specifically can present as a quantitative decrease in psychomotor activity and includes paucity of movement, immobility, staring, mutism, rigidity, withdrawal and refusal to eat, ambitendency, and negativism Excited catatonia, specifically, includes severe psychomotor agitation, impulsivity, and combativeness Abnormal psychomotor activity can be seen in both hypoactive and excited catatonia and can include posturing, grimacing, waxy flexibility, echolalia or echopraxia, stereotypy, verbigeration, and automatic obedience Treatment Early psychiatry consultation is important due to thorough evaluation of catatonia involving response to treatment (diagnostic and therapeutic) Reversal and treatment of underlying causes of catatonia First line treatment for catatonia is benzodiazepines Typically start with lorazepam 2 mg IV and assess response Response to treatment can be rapid within minutes Early psychiatry involvement is important for this reason for full evaluation of symptoms before and after intervention Catatonia due to non-psychiatric etiologies typically respond less robustly to benzodiazepines Treatment with benzodiazepines and/or ECT often continues for weeks to months following initial diagnosis Navigating \"Difficult\" Patient Interactions Authors: Katherine Termini and Jonathan Smith Background Between 15-60% of patient-physician interactions are considered \"difficult\" by the physician. Patients in these interactions also often report dissatisfaction, feeling unheard or uncared for. Patients want to feel their unique perspective is understood by their team, even if that perspective differs from the team. Reaching this understanding can often resolve conflict. Difficult patient interactions increase the risk for physician burnout. It is important to note that most difficult interactions are not due to psychiatric illness. Communication Tips When a patient has very strong affect towards you, try not to take this personally as it is rarely related to you specifically. Remain calm and unflappable while in the room, even if the patient is upset. Focus on breathing deeply and pause before speaking. Attempt to identify and verbally reflect the patient's emotional state. Understand that you cannot reason someone out of something he/she was not reasoned into Minimize blaming and \"you\" statements Acknowledge that being in the hospital is hard work for the patient, and the team wants to work with the patient toward a common goal. Acknowledge that the interaction/relationship is less than ideal and how that may be impacting their care. Assist a patient in revising unrealistic expectations by providing education, but always keep the reason for their expectations at the center (refusing a procedure due to fear of death or feeling out of control). Indicate the patient's own role and responsibilities in their care\u2014highlight the things that they have direct control over. Angry Patients: The 5 A's Acknowledge the problem and patient's anger Allow the patient to vent uninterrupted Agree on what the root problem is Affirm what can be done to address this problem Assure follow-through That said, prioritize safety of patients and staff. If the patient is escalating to physical agitation, defer negotiations to a later time. Do not stay in the room if you feel that your physical safety is in danger or if the patient is being verbally assaultive. You never need the patient's permission to leave the room. Splitting A coping mechanism by which a patient views others as either good or bad without middle ground This often manifests as different team members having different types of interactions with the patient or hearing different things from the patient. The patient may idealize some team members and villainize others. If possible, have all team members (primary, consultants, bedside nurse) meet with the patient at the same time. Alternatively, have all treatment plans be delivered by one central person (primary resident) with bedside nurse present Provide patient a written summary of this plan. Find ways to make small, reasonable concessions that give the patient more control over their care and day-to-day experience (e.g. shifting the timing of medications). Set clear expectations and boundaries (e.g. team will terminate discussion and leave the room if the patient begins cursing at them) and follow-through on them When feeling stuck, consulting the psychiatry consultation liaison service can help address psychiatric factors that may be contributing or can play a mediating role Alcohol Use Disorder Author: Ben Johnson Background 50% of hospitalized patients drink alcohol. At-risk alcohol use is >14 drinks/week or >5 drinks in a sitting for men. For women and men >65, 7 per week, >4 per sitting. Alcohol withdrawal onset occurs 6-12 hours after last drink, with 90% having non-severe course. CIWA score <10 at 24-48 hours indicates low risk of worsening symptoms Risk of seizures greatest at 12-24 hrs, occurring in ~3% of patients Risk of delirium greatest at 48-72 hrs, occurring in ~5% Risk Assessment Risk factors: Prior seizures/delirium tremons (most significant risk factor), co-substance use (especially benzodiazepines), no abstinent days in past month, presenting BAL >200, dysautonomia CIWA protocol is appropriate for patients at low risk of severe withdrawal For non-low risk patients, consider benzodiazepine/barbiturate load and standing taper Prediction of Alcohol Withdrawal Severity Scale (PAWSS) can be used to stratify risk of complicated alcohol withdrawal (seizure and DT risk); 1 point per question: - Intoxicated in the previous 30 days? - Previous episode of withdrawal from alcohol? - Previous withdrawal seizures? - Previous delirium tremens? - Previous detoxification from alcohol? - History of blackouts? - Concurrent use of benzodiazepines or barbiturates in last 90 days? - Concurrent use of other recreational substances within the last 90 days? - Positive BAL on admission? - Evidence of autonomic hyperactivity (tachycardia, diastolic HTN, diaphoresis, nausea)? PAWSS score of 4 or greater is also considered high risk for complicated withdrawal - Indications for admission: prior severe withdrawal (withdrawal seizures or delirium), PAWSS score of 4 or greater, comorbidities (medical and psychiatric illness), pregnancy, significant impairment in social/occupational functioning, communication barriers, social barriers Presentation Acute intoxication: disinhibition, slurred speech, ataxia, nystagmus Acute withdrawal: nausea, vomiting, anxiety, agitation, audio-visual and tactile hallucinations, headache, diaphoresis, fine motor tremor while arms and fingers outstretched, autonomic hyperactivity Chronic heavy use: sequelae of chronic liver disease and malnutrition, including thiamine deficiency Caine criteria for Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy 2 or more: (1) malnutrition, (2) ataxia, (3) oculomotor abnormalities, (4) AMS Evaluation Identify last use, quantity per day/week, other sedative-hypnotic use, history of withdrawal, social/occupational dysfunction, other toxic forms of alcohol compounds including methanol and ethylene glycol Acute Alcohol Withdrawal Labs: blood alcohol level, urine toxicology (+/- ethyl glucuronide to detect use in prior 3 days), BMP, CBC, LFTs (AST:ALT elevation 2:1), CK and \u03b2-hCG CIWA score quantifies severity, though subject to inflation by subjective symptoms Management of Acute Alcohol Withdrawal Diazepam-based Protocols Include hold parameters throughout the duration of the load and taper (sedation and hypopnea) and discontinue further doses for emergent toxicity (dysarthria, ataxia, nystagmus) Low risk patients: CIWA-based symptom-triggered protocol - eg: diazepam 20 mg po q1h for CIWA greater than 20 or if 15-19 for 2 consecutive hours Non-low risk patients: - Load: Diazepam 20 mg q1h x3 doses followed by Diazepam 10 mg q4h PRN for first 24 hours to identify total diazepam requirement to achieve RASS score of 0 - Taper: Schedule 20% taper per day from original 24-hour requirement divided into TID or QID dosing schedule Non-low risk patients with hepatic impairment - Substitute lorazepam (risk of long-acting accumulation) - Load: Lorazepam 2 mg q1h PO/IV x3 dose followed by Lorazepam 2 mg q4h + 1mg q4h PRN for the first 24 hours to identify total lorazepam requirement to achieve RASS score of 0 - Taper: Schedule 20% taper per day from original 24-hour requirement divided into QID dosing schedule - DO NOT discontinue taper early (but do hold doses for toxicity) as abrupt discontinuation of a short acting agent can result in delayed lorazepam withdrawal seizure Phenobarbital-based Protocols Benzodiazepine resistance: likely due to cross-tolerance between alcohol and benzodiazepines Considerations: No reduction in CIWA after 60-80 mg of diazepam No reduction of CIWA in 24 hours Previous DTs or seizures Concurrent use of benzodiazepines and alcohol Phenobarbital load: 8-12 mg/kg (up to 15 mg/kg) divided into 3 doses 3 hours apart Taper may or may not be necessary after initial weight-based load but may consider: 60-120 mg q4h on 2nd day, 30-60 mg q4h on 3rd day, and 30 mg on 4th day, then discontinue Special Considerations Add folate, multivitamin, and electrolyte repletion If >2 Caine criteria, treat empirically for Wernicke's encephalopathy with high-dose IV thiamine (500 mg TID IV x 3-5 days) Consider Addiction Psychiatry consultation for complex presentations Long-term Management of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) After withdrawal stabilization, engage the patient in discussion around use and educate on connection between use and presenting medical problems Refer to Motivational Interviewing section for further guidance Pharmacotherapy (MAUD) should be discussed with all patients prior to discharge, and if interested, MAUD should be initiated regardless of abstinence goal If patient does not have abstinence goal, harm reduction may be achieved through reduction in quantity and/or frequency of drinking Naltrexone and topiramate have evidence for non-abstinence outcomes Pharmacologic Interventions Naltrexone (cannot be on opioid agonist): - Need 7-10 days since last opioid before starting - 25 mg x1 day, then titrate up to 50 mg daily; also available in q30d IM - Monitor liver enzymes; AST/ALT must be < 3-5x ULN Acamprosate: - Head-to-head, inferior to naltrexone (see COMBINE trial) - Contraindicated with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min; dose reduced when 30-60 mL/min - 333 mg TID, titrating to 666 mg TID dosing Disulfiram: - Infrequently used outside of extreme motivation (e.g. professional under monitoring); would not use outside of specialist care - Must abstain from alcohol ~2 weeks after last dose, given risk of disulfiram-ethanol reaction (DER), which can be fatal depending upon disulfiram and ethanol doses Topiramate: - Not FDA-approved for AUD, but has significant supporting evidence - Useful for individuals without abstinence goal - Titrate slowly over 8 weeks to 200-300 mg/d Gabapentin: - Not FDA-approved for AUD, but with some evidence and national guideline recommendations; however, continuation after discharge from acute care many be affected by controlled substance classification - Useful for post-acute withdrawal anxiety, insomnia, or co-occurring neuropathy - Titrate to 900-1800 mg/d divided into TID dosing, monitoring for sedation - Risk of sedation/apnea if concomitant alcohol use, so recommend patient discontinue if alcohol relapse occurs Additional Psychosocial Treatments Effective for AUD include 12-step groups (AA, SMART Recovery), cognitive behavioral therapy, sober living facilities, family therapy, contingency management, and IOP/residential treatment. Consultation with Addiction Psychiatry or General Psychiatry is available to support management of AUD. Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) Author: Ben Johnson Background Standard of care is opioid stabilization with buprenorphine or methadone (in OUD) or other full agonist opioids (in chronic opioid therapy) Methadone and buprenorphine can be ordered by any physician for inpatients; buprenorphine can also now be prescribed at discharge by any physician, though methadone for OUD must be dispensed directly from a federally regulated Opioid Treatment Program (\u201cmethadone clinic\u201d) Maintenance agonist therapy should be offered to every patient, with preference for an \u201copt-out\u201d approach (even for uninsured patients through state grant funding) Presentation (Withdrawal) Restlessness/psychomotor activation, anxiety, irritability, nausea, abdominal cramping, loose stool, diffuse musculoskeletal pain, chills, insomnia, yawning Pupillary dilation, piloerection, tearing, nasal congestion, diaphoresis, restless legs Evaluation Due to the partial agonist mu-opioid effect of buprenorphine and high binding affinity, premature induction of buprenorphine in patients previously using full-agonist opioids rapidly induces a withdrawal state (precipitated withdrawal) Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS): quantifies severity of opioid withdrawal and allows for safer buprenorphine inductions Approximates the mu opioid receptor availability to avoid premature induction and precipitated withdrawal in the setting of buprenorphine induction while also allowing for adequate treatment of withdrawal symptoms Asking about opioid exposure: \"You're uncomfortable. I work with a lot of people in the hospital, and some come with regular exposure to opioids from a lot of different places (their doctors, friends), should we be treating any withdrawal for you?\" Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) \u2013 Ben Johnson Buprenorphine Background: - Partial agonist at the mu opioid receptor with high binding affinity - Long half-life (24-36 hours) allows for daily dosing - TID dosing is more effective for acute pain (as the analgesic effect is shorter-lived) - OK to use in renal failure/HD; may reduce dose in hepatic injury or switch to monoproduct buprenorphine (Child-Pugh Class C) - All non-pregnant patients should receive buprenorphine-naloxone (e.g. Suboxone) formulations to mitigate risk of diversion/injection Management: Induction: All opioid medication must be held 12+ hours prior to first buprenorphine dose (typically, this opioid-free period is overnight from 9 PM to 9 AM), and recorded COWS score > 10 to mitigate risk of precipitated withdrawal 2-4 mg is given SL, monitoring for oversedation; additional 2-4 mg is given q1h up to a total of 12 mg in first day Only sedation or hypopnea should prevent a full 12 mg dose Typical starting dose: 12-16mg/day SL Maintenance: 4-32mg SL daily; 16mg and above to suppress opioid use, 24 mg is sufficient in most cases All patient on Suboxone must have a prescription at discharge and a follow-up appointment for continued outpatient treatment No DEA waiver required; any physician may prescribe buprenorphine for OUD at discharge Acute pain management in patients using buprenorphine: There is no contraindication to full-agonist opioid analgesia for breakthrough pain If the etiology of patients pain would require opioid therapy in a non-OUD patient, do not avoid opioids; these may be used safely in the hospital Peri-operative pain management: continue buprenorphine at reduced and split doses (4mg BID or TID); will prevent withdrawal and cravings, but NOT manage new pain Post-operatively: Reduce opioid requirements and increase buprenorphine to home dose If buprenorphine was discontinued, will require induction procedure to avoid precipitated withdrawal Methadone Background: - Full mu opioid agonist with additional NMDA-receptor activity - Better option for individuals who cannot tolerate the buprenorphine induction procedure or with significant chronic or escalating pain - Long half life: 12-36 hrs - Limit titration to 10mg/d q7d, to prevent dose-stacking and delayed overdose - eg: 40 mg po qd increased to 50 mg po qd for one week prior to further titration to 60 mg po qd - Safe in renal failure; dose reduction for hepatic injury - Potential for QT prolongation at higher doses, warrants QTc monitoring Management: Induction: In the hospital, start at 10 mg TID, holding doses for sedation or hypopnea Lower doses if concerned for respiratory compromise or concurrent CNS depressant therapy First dose cannot exceed 30 mg, and no more than 40 mg in first 24 hours; then titrate 5 mg/d q3d while admitted Federally regulated titration limits Maintenance: Must confirm dose with methadone clinic before restarting outpatient dose Until then, do not give more than initial doses (30 mg in single dose, 40 mg in first 24 hours) After confirming home dose, continue as single daily dose or divide if patient is experiencing an acute pain generator or has a medical reason for induction of metabolism (eg pregnancy may require split dosing in the 2nd/3rd trimester; medication interactions may have similar effects or require dose reduction if metabolism is inhibited) Naltrexone Mu opioid antagonist Half-life oral ~4 hours but clinically active ~24 hrs IM maintains clinically effective levels up to 30 days (not available for inpatient administration) Only IM formulation is evidence-based to prevent return-to-use of illicit opioids, though PO formulation can be useful to introduce medication Can precipitate withdrawal Requires 7-10 days opioid abstinence prior to initiation If due for monthly injection while admitted, may substitute oral formulation (50mg po qd) until discharged to outpatient provider to receive injection Additional Information Psychosocial Interventions that complement MOUD: Consider referral to SUD counseling, mutual help (self-help, 12-step, AA), intensive outpatient, and short- or long-term residential treatment Use of other drugs NOT a contraindication to MOUD; however, should encourage abstinence from other drugs during therapy (especially benzodiazepines) Prescribe intranasal naloxone for overdose prevention to all OUD patients discharging from hospital, regardless of MOUD status Tobacco Use Disorder (TUD) Author: Ben Johnson Background All patients should be screened for nicotine use (smoking, chewing, and vaping of nicotine containing products) Nicotine withdrawal is one of the most common reasons that patients leave the hospital before medically advised Hospitalized patients receiving pharmacotherapy for nicotine use have higher rates of cessation Management Combination therapy is superior to single therapy alone Basal Transdermal nicotine patch provides sustained levels of nicotine More than 10 cigarettes (1/2 pack) per day: 21 mg patch Less than 10 cigarettes (1/2 pack) per day: 14 mg patch Remove overnight, abnormal dreams and nightmares are a common if not removed Bolus Gum/ Lozenge provides immediate nicotine for breakthrough cravings First cigarette within 30 minutes of waking: 4 mg gum/lozenge First cigarette after 30 minutes of waking: 2 mg gum/lozenge Patients smoking 1+ packs per day will likely still require 4 mg gum/lozenge Order q1h prn as patients will titrate utilization as they would with their outpatient nicotine use Chew and park method for nicotine gum; sublingual absorption needed to bypass first metabolism Other Medications Varenicline: Equivalent efficacy to combination NRT for smoking cessation Limited utility in the inpatient setting due to side effect tolerability and need for dose titration over multiple days Bupropion: Effective but less efficacious than combination NRT and varenicline Limited utility in the inpatient setting due to dose titration over a week and delay in steady state blood levels Contraindicated in those with seizure disorder and those at risk of seizures Motivational Interviewing Author: Laura Artim and Ben Johnson Background Motivational interviewing: an evidence-based form of patient-centered interviewing that strives to align with patient's own strengths to encourage change in behavior via strengthening their own motivation for change For inpatients, MI is most useful for encouraging medication adherence before discharge or substance use cessation as well as healthier lifestyle habits Assumptions/Principles Only is in state of ambivalence, whether outwardly expressed or not Ambivalence is expressed with conflict between multiple courses of action Patient's intrinsic motivation to change may fluctuate at any given time, some patients may benefit from explaining this model of behavior change Techniques to Identify Ambivalence Focus on reasons to change (\"why\") as opposed to specific actions (\"how\") Express empathy: discussion about values, hopes, emotions, and goals surrounding behavior. Don't shy away from verbalizing strengths you recognize in patient Empower self-efficacy: ask about other times they have made changes in life Develop discrepancy between current and desired behavior through reflection and summaries such as \"I'm hearing that drinking helps you relax, but I'm also hearing that you are worried about its impact on your health\" Avoid argument and authoritarian mentality - ask for permission to give your own thoughts, don't \"give advice\" as an equalizer between you and patient Defuse resistance to change - emphasize patient autonomy and reflect resistance Evaluation Continuing the Conversation \"OARS\" interviewing skills: Open-ended questions, Affirm, Reflect, Summarize Open-ended questions encourage thoughtful responses and provide flexibility on how to answer Affirmations acknowledge the good, accentuate the positive, and recognize the inherent worth of another human being Reflections are a guess by the listener as to what the speaker means Summaries are similar to reflections and pull together several ideas Simply reflecting what patient said in slightly different terms often leads to patient feeling heard and recognized Most effective in conjunction with other treatments, when patients are willing, and when patients express ideas for change themselves Least effective in group format and when patient feels change comes from authority May be effective to have SMART goal setting if patient is in any stage except precontemplation: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time-limited, but only once permission has been granted","title":"Psychiatry"},{"location":"Psychiatry/#psychiatry","text":"Editors: Ben Johnson, MD and Snehal Bindra, MD Reviewed by: Jonathan Smith, MD and Daniel Daunis, MD","title":"PSYCHIATRY"},{"location":"Psychiatry/#agitation-management","text":"Author: Ben Johnson","title":"Agitation Management"},{"location":"Psychiatry/#background","text":"Agitation in the hospital results from discomfort, illness, medication effects or frustrations the patient is unable to meaningfully communicate.

VBG usually adequate for clinical decision making. Usually obtained by RT, more cumbersome to obtain unless patient has an arterial line VBG pH, PvCO2 , HCO3 Non-invasive, cheaper, pH reliably correlates to ABG Cannot assess oxygenation, PCO2 and HCO3 are less accurate than ABG especially in certain conditions (shock, hypercapnia) Can be drawn off a peripheral IV or central line. A peripheral VBG PvO2 cannot be substituted for a Mixed Venous O2 from a central line Culturally, we use VBGs most often for: - Assessing ventilation (pCO2):** - Concern for COPD exacerbation, to assess CO2 retention - Respiratory support adjustments: Assessment of patient's response to BiPAP or mechanical ventilation / determine whether setting changes are indicated - Generalized mental status changes, e.g. lethargy, confusion - Hypoventilation -> increased pCO2 and decreased pH -> encephalopathy Assessing Acid/Base status (DKA, renal failure, sepsis, etc) Important to note, as stated above, VBG PCO2 and HCO3 are less accurate in shock and hypercapnia, so interpret with caution Assessing Respiratory Acid/Base Status: Respiratory Status pH PaCO2 (Primary Change) HCO3 (Compensation) Etiology/DDx Normal 7.36-7.44 36-44 22-26 Respiratory Acidosis =< 7.35 >= 45 mmHG Acute: 1 mEq increase per 10 mmHG increase in PCO2; Chronic: 3-4 mEq increase per 10 mmHg increase in PCO2 Impaired gas exchange, decreased respiratory drive, chest/diaphragm dysfunction, iatrogenic (vent issues) Respiratory Alkalosis >= 7.45 =< 35 mmHg Acute: 2 mEq decrease per 10 mmHg PCO2; Chronic: 4-5 mEq decrease per 10 mmHg decrease in PCO2 Increased respiratory drive (pain, fever, anxiety), hypoxia-induced (high altitude, PE, anemia), sepsis, iatrogenic (vent issues) In a compensated respiratory disturbance (i.e. normal pH): you do not need to intervene and try to normalize the PCO2) Further management largely depends on underlying cause - In general, avoid correcting respiratory acidosis with sodium bicarbonate, even if not fully compensated; there is a lack of evidence demonstrating clinical benefit and potential risks associated - See Nephrology section for further discussion on metabolic acid/base disorders Hypoxia and Hypoxemia Author: Jacob Lee Background and Definitions Hypoxia: A condition where the oxygen supply is inadequate either to the body as a whole (general hypoxia) or to a specific region (tissue hypoxia) Hypoxemia: low oxygen in arterial blood, as measured by PaO2 or SpO2 Can be both hypoxic without hypoxemia (i.e. anemia, cardiogenic shock) and hypoxemic without hypoxia (i.e. mild V/Q mismatch states) but severe hypoxemia will almost always cause hypoxia Measuring Oxygenation Two major ways to measure oxygenation, which are inter-related: SpO2 (oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry or \"pulse ox\") - the percentage of hemoglobin that's saturated with oxygen; \u226595% considered normal PaO2 - partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood; 75-100 considered normal SpO2 and PaO2 can be interconverted using the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve (sigmoidal curve) - PaO2 ~100 \u2192 SpO2 ~98-100%; PaO2 ~ 60 \u2192 SpO2 ~90%; Below PaO2 of 60, small decreases in PaO2 cause large drops in SpO2 (hemoglobin loses affinity for oxygen) - The curve can shift to the right (hemoglobin has lower affinity for oxygen) due to elevated levels of CO2, low pH, and increased temperature/fever A-a gradient: the difference in the partial pressure of oxygen as measured in the alveoli (A) and arterial blood (a); normal is (Age+10)/4; See 'Basics of Blood Gases' for more details Mechanisms of Hypoxia Hypoxemic Hypoxia \u2013 low PaO2 leads to poor tissue oxygenation (examples below) Anemic Hypoxia \u2013 normal PaO2 but reduced hemoglobin leads to reduced oxygen carrying capacity and thus decreased tissue oxygenation (i.e. anemia, CO poisoning, methemoglobinemia) Circulatory Hypoxia \u2013 states of inadequate perfusion (shock) leading to poor tissue oxygenation (i.e. shock, heart failure, ischemia) Histotoxic Hypoxia \u2013 inability of tissues to use oxygen (i.e. cyanide poisoning, mitochondrial dysfunction, sepsis) Demand Hypoxia \u2013 oxygen requirements exceed oxygen delivery (i.e. hypermetabolic states such as thyrotoxicosis, sepsis, prolonged seizures, prolonged exercise) Mechanism Pathophysiology Improvement with Supplemental O2 A-a Gradient Examples Low FiO2 Low fraction of inspired oxygen causes low PAO2 and thus low PaO2 Yes Normal High-Altitude Hypoventilation Low oxygen delivery from low RR or TV to the alveoli reduces PAO2 and thus low PaO2 Yes, if ventilation (RR or TV) increase Normal Neuromuscular disease, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, opioid overdose V/Q Mismatch 1.

Fernandez III, Stacy McIntyre Presentation Sub-acute to acute progressive worsening of dyspnea, chest tightness, wheezing, and cough Important historical cues: Prior hx of asthma, adherence to controller medications, triggers (exercise, allergens, cold) Risk stratifying: Hx of intubations/ exacerbations, recent steroid course for exacerbation Physical exam: wheezing, poor air movement, tachypnea, \u2191 work of breathing, hypoxemia Peak flows can help and are often cited in literature but do not change management acutely, can be useful as baseline for assessing response to therapy. PEF <200 L/min or PEF <50% predicted indicates severe obstruction, PEF <70% predicted indicates moderate exacerbation) Evaluation Generally aimed at ruling out causes for exacerbation and other diagnoses; these are not required but should be considered in pts being admitted for inpt management: - EKG, trop, BNP, D-dimer to assess for cardiac cause (ACS, CHF, PE) - CXR to rule out underlying process (PNA, PTX, atelectasis) - ABG/VBG not routinely needed unless ill-appearing, tachypneic, or lethargic/altered - Dangerous signs and possible ICU if : - Tachypnea >30 and/or significantly increased work-of-breathing - Hypercapnia or even normocapnia (these pts are usually hyperventilating; a normal CO2 in a severe asthma exacerbation could indicate impending respiratory failure) - Altered mental status - Requiring continuous nebulizers Management Good asthma care requires frequent re-evaluation. Generally, reassess q1h after treatment initiation. If deteriorating, step up the ladder of management ABC: if not protecting airway, intubate and admit to ICU Peak expiratory flow (Order in EPIC \"Peak Flow Measurement\"). If pt cannot do it, consider A/VBG if ill-appearing, tachypneic, lethargic/AMS, or thinking about engaging ICU SpO2 goal 93-95%.

Good data for no need to taper in general population, sometimes considered in someone with multiple severe exacerbations. Step down SABA-Nebulizer treatments based on wheezing Inspiratory/Expiratory wheezing q2 -> q3; Mostly Expiratory wheezing q3 -> q4; Minimal Wheezing q4 -> q6 or PRN. (Pediatrics 2000; 106 (5): 1006\u201312) No need for empiric antibiotics unless there is concern for bacterial infection, then treat as Pneumonia (see Pneumonia chapters) Prior to discharge: Ensure that pt is on appropriate controller medications. See outpt management section but consider starting an ICS/LABA as part of SMART (JAMA 2018; 319(14):1485\u20131496) Evaluate for causes of acute exacerbation to prevent future events (noncompliance, resp viruses, allergies, exposures, etc.). Evaluate for asthma inflammatory phenotype after recovery (IgE, peripheral eos, ABPA) Can consider writing a simple asthma action plan (https://ginasthma.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GINA-Pt-Guide-2021-copy.pdf) Consider follow up with PCP vs. pulmonologist for evaluation of outpt regimen COPD Exacerbation Author: Brian Haimerl Etiology: infection (~70%; viral more often than bacterial), allergens, pollution, seasonal variations (colder temperatures), PE Presentation: acute increase/worsening (< 14d) in 1 or more \"cardinal symptom\" (cough, sputum production/purulence, dyspnea) Often associated with tachypnea, tachycardia, and diffuse wheezing Confounders/contributors: Pts with COPD can have other causes of respiratory distress including ACS, decompensated heart failure, PE, PNA, PTX, sepsis, acidosis Evaluation Initial Assessment: ABCs Airway: Ensure pt is protecting airway - CO2 narcosis can impair consciousness Breathing: focus on respiratory status Evaluate for wheezes, rales, rhonchi, stridor, air movement, and work of breathing Severe respiratory insufficiency: accessory muscle use, fragmented speech, inability to lie supine, diaphoresis, agitation, asynchrony between chest and abdominal wall with respiration, failure to improve with initial emergency treatment Impending respiratory arrest: Inability to maintain respiratory effort, cyanosis, hemodynamic instability, and depressed mental status Circulation Assess for signs of hemodynamic instability (hypotension, severe tachycardia or tachypnea, cold vs warm extremities, capillary refill, mental status) Subsequent Workup: - Labs: ABG/VBG, CBC, CMP, troponin, BNP, sputum cx, RPP, blood cultures - Imaging: CXR, POCUS (assess for lung slide, B-lines), - Consider: - Lactate, procalcitonin, urine Legionella, fungal workup in select pts - Extremity Doppler US (Assess for DVT) - CTA PE: Not recommended for every pt admitted for COPD exacerbation; use clinical judgement and scoring tools (Well's Criteria) to make clinical decision; studies show up to 25% of patients admitted for AECOPD have concurrent PE Management Supplemental O2: target saturation 88-92% for everyone - BiPAP typically appropriate for severe COPD exacerbation unless contraindication (vomiting, obtundation, facial trauma) - BiPAP is ordered as IPAP and EPAP, 12/5 is often a good start - If obtunded, in severe respiratory distress, hemodynamic instability \u2192intubation Bronchodilators/Inhalers - Order \"Respiratory Care Therapy Management Protocol\" at VUMC - RT evaluates the pt and based on physical exam will give a duoneb. Continues to assess the pt and treats based on severity of the exacerbation - If ordering bronchodilators individually: - Albuterol 2.5 mg diluted to 3 mL via nebulizer or 4 to 8 inhalations from MDI every 4 hours while awake (RT) or more frequently if needed - Ipratropium 500 mcg via nebulizer, or 4-8 inhalations from MDI q4 hrs while awake - Preferred is Duoneb (albuterol and ipratropium) q4-6 hours at VUMC - There is no respiratory order protocol at the VA, order individually as above - Home Inhalers: Usually continue home long-acting bronchodilators (LABA/LAMA) w/ or w/o ICS during exacerbations unless receiving frequent scheduled nebs (per GOLD 2023) Steroids: Indicated for moderate to severe exacerbations (almost anyone being admitted) - IV vs. PO: studies have shown no significant differences in treatment failure, mortality, hospital readmissions, or LOS between IV or PO - Generally, PO prednisone 40mg x5d is appropriate - In severe exacerbations, may receive IV methylprednisolone 125mg in ER (this will count as day 1 when converting to PO prednisone) - Consider steroid taper if pt has not substantially recovered, has frequent exacerbations, Antibiotics: Recommended by GOLD guidelines if all 3 cardinal symptoms or 2 if one is purulent sputum - Azithromycin (500mg x 1 then 250mg daily x 4 or 500mg daily x 3) or doxycycline 100 mg BID if concern for QT prolongation. Can consider respiratory fluroquinolone in certain high-risk pts - Pseudomonal coverage if: chronic colonization or infection past 12mo, FEV1 <30% predicted, bronchiectasis, BSA use w/in past 3mo, chronic systemic glucocorticoid use - Refer to Pneumonia in Infection Disease chapter if treating concomitant pneumonia Other Inpatient Therapies - Magnesium: Often used In the ED (2g IV mag sulfate), though not great data. Has bronchodilator activity and reduced hospitalizations when used in stable COPD pts - Reasonable to give as low risk (consider renal insufficiency or myasthenia patients) - Pulmonary Hygiene: consider guaifenesin / other airway clearance therapy Discharge Planning: - Controller medications/inhalers (see COPD in Outpt chapter) - Make sure any new inhalers are covered by insurance prior to discharge - Provide inhaler education and consider use of a spacer - Vaccinations (influenza, COVID, pneumococcal, RSV) - Early follow-up w/ COPD provider (w/in 1mo) -- Increased 90d mortality for those who do not attend early f/u - Fellows will often arrange early outpatient follow up if on a pulmonary service Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Exacerbation Author: Hannah Kieffer Background Presentation: Acute worsening of pulmonary symptoms such as new/worsening cough, congestion, sputum production or change in sputum quality, dyspnea. May have constitutional symptoms including fever, fatigue, poor appetite Pathogenesis: viral infections, bacterial overgrowth (most common include Pseudomonas, S. aureus, Burkholderia), NTM, treatment non-adherence Evaluation History: Always ask about hemoptysis \u2013 see \"Hemoptysis\" section if present Labs: Sputum culture (specify CF culture), RPP Imaging: CXR PA and lateral See \"Cystic Fibrosis\" Admission order set in Epic to reference work up suggestions Severity Grading No exact protocol. Determined by the degree of change from baseline versus the severity of the symptoms Management All pts need a Cystic Fibrosis Pulmonary consult (unless on Rogers Pulmonary if attending specializes in CF). FYI there is no fellow so don't worry when you have to page an attending Often these pts are direct admissions from CF clinic and the attending will help guide management Notably, some mild cases do not require admission; can be managed outpatient with increased airway clearance frequency and oral antibiotics Inpatient Management: for moderate to severe exacerbations All CF pts are placed on contact precautions no matter the indication for their hospitalization Antibiotic selection - Be aware that the antibiotic doses are NOT the typical doses used for other indications. Use Epic Order Set: Adult Cystic Fibrosis (or per CF team, pharmacy) - Check CF notes, recent hospitalizations, culture data (e.g. MRSA, MSSA, Pseudomonas) to determine previously colonized bacteria to target - If they were recently admitted and improved on a certain antibiotic regimen, it is usually a good empiric choice. CF team will ultimately guide regimen - Most patients will receive dual IV anti-pseudomonal coverage (per previous CF Foundation recommendations) - General coverage for Pseudomonas: penicillin class (cephalosporin, carbapenem, extended penicillin) AND aminoglycoside or ciprofloxacin. Second line Colistin. - General coverage for MRSA: vancomycin (Bactrim or linezolid for allergies) - Treatment duration is based on improvement in symptoms and FEV1 recovery, usually 14-21 days - In most cases, hold home suppressive antibiotics (inhaled tobramycin, azithromycin) during a flare. Check with CF attending as there are some exceptions Airway/sputum clearance - Schedule Albuterol nebs prior to airway clearance regimen or inhaled treatment - Continue home regimen. May include: Pulmozyme, hypertonic saline, positive end expiratory pressure valve (PEP e.g. Flutter, Acapella), chest percussive devices (vest, wand) - See 'Airway Clearance Therapy' for additional details - Consider increasing frequency of airway clearance regimen from home baseline CF modulators (e.g. Trikafta -ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elaxacaftor): - Continue if on at home - Needs a non-formulary order to use own supply - Time with fat rich meal for absorption Nutrition/GI - Continue any home pancreatic enzymes, order at bedside for pt administration - Always continue ADEK vitamins - Daily to 3 times a week weight checks - Nutrition consult - Should be on a bowel regimen Other - Glucocorticoids - Consider if patient presents with features of acute asthma episode - Note: their use has not been demonstrated to improve outcomes - Tamiflu if test positive for Influenza DIOS - Distal Intestinal Obstruction Syndrome Acute obstruction (complete or incomplete) in ileocecum by inspissated intestinal contents. Presents with progressive cramping, abdominal pain (RLQ)/distension, constipation, poor appetite, and possibly vomiting that often looks like mechanical obstruction Pathogenesis: multifactorial including insufficient pancreatic enzyme activity, dehydration, and intestinal dysmotility CT can help rule out acute intraabdominal pathology (intussusception, SBO, appendicitis, volvulus) and typically shows proximal small bowel dilation and stool burden in distal ileum Treatment: If tolerating PO, treat with Miralax and/or Golytely. If not tolerating PO or with bilious vomiting, might need hyperosmolar contrast enema (gastrografin). RARELY requires surgery, try medical management first Prevention is key! Pts with CF should be on a bowel regimen in the outpatient setting. Hemoptysis Authors: Angela Liu, Henry Brems Background Distinguish between massive (>600cc/24hr or >100cc/hr) and non-massive hemoptysis. Can be difficult to quantify expectorated blood volume and volume that is retained in lungs Massive is potentially life-threatening due to impaired ventilation UGIB (hematemesis) and nasopharyngeal bleeds can easily mimic hemoptysis Presentation based on source of bleed: Structure Etiologies Airways Bronchitis (common cause of non-massive), bronchiectasis (especially in CF pts), neoplasm Alveolar/Parenchymal Infectious (bacterial PNA, abscess, TB, fungal, aspergilloma), rheumatologic (Goodpasture's, GPA, Behcet's) Vascular PE, AVM, CHF, mitral stenosis, bronchovascular fistula Other Coagulopathy, traumatic, foreign-body, iatrogenic, cocaine-induced Evaluation Determine coagulation status: medications, PT/PTT, platelets Labs: CBC, BMP, coags, UA (for hematuria), ABG (evaluate oxygenation), type and screen Consider ANA, ANCA, anti-GBM, anti-cardiopipin, IFNG release assay, sputum culture (bacteria, fungal, AFB), sputum cytology (if not undergoing bronchoscopy), and RPP depending on clinical context Imaging: CXR first (to evaluate etiology and to localize the source to a side). Chest CT depending on prior workup, severity of bleed, and stability of pt Bronchoscopy is sometimes indicated to localize bleeding source. Management Urgent evaluation if any hemodynamic compromise, hypoxia, hypercarbia, or respiratory distress Ensure a secure airway: massive hemoptysis may require intubation and MICU transfer Reverse underlying coagulopathy if present. Consider trending HCT If unilateral bleed, place bleeding lung down. Ex: if the source is left lung, place pt on left side to prevent filling 'good' lung with blood (include this info in sign-out if known) Urgent Pulmonary consult if clinical instability: Bronchoscopy is diagnostic and therapeutic. Obtain CT Bronchial Artery Protocol if concern for bronchial artery source (especially in CF pts) so embolization can be planned Order this at VUMC with a CTA Chest (NOT a CTA PE as that will be timed incorrectly) and include \"bronchial artery protocol\" in comments for the study Consider IR consult for angiography as diagnostic and therapeutic option Consult early if there is massive hemoptysis. If bronchoscopy is attempted but fails to stop the bleed, they can get to angiography fastest if IR has already been made aware Recurrent hemoptysis is still typically controlled with repeat embolization. Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) Authors: Madelaine Behrens, Jacob Lee Background Heterogenous group of parenchymal lung diseases characterized by inflammation and subsequent fibrosis of the lung parenchyma, particularly the interstitium Pathophysiology: Repetitive cycles of inflammation leads to scarring with associated loss of lung volume, compliance and impaired gas exchange Etiologies ILD can be broadly divided into primary (idiopathic) causes and secondary causes Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonias (IIPs) Secondary Causes Chronic Fibrosing: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) Connective tissue disease: systemic sclerosis (most common cause of ILD), Sjogren's, RA (ILD is the most common pulmonary manifestation), dermatomyositis, polymyositis, SLE (least common to cause ILD), MCTD Smoking-Related: Respiratory Bronchiolitis-Associated ILD (RB-ILD), Desquamatitive interstitial pneumonia (DIP) Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (organic): farm exposures, chickens, pesticide, stored grains, mold (e.g. water damage in home, hot tub) Acute/Subacute: Acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP), Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP, formerly BOOP) Iatrogenic*: amiodarone, bleomycin, MTX, busulfan, immunotherapies, TKI, TNF-a inhibitors, nitrofurantoin, hydralazine, radiation Rare IIPs: Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP), Pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE), Acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia-pattern (AFOP) Pneumoconioses (inorganic): coal mines, silica, asbestos, beryllium, organic solvents, heavy metals Unclassifiable ILD Sarcoidosis Vasculitis: granulomatis with polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis Other: pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, amyloidosis, pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis *Over 150 medications are linked to ILD (www.pneumotox.com is the best reference for drugs associated with specific ILD patterns) Evaluation Symptoms: progressive, dry cough, dyspnea, and fatigue are classic for IIPs - Other symptoms are usually related to the underlying secondary cause History: - PMHx: AI disease (should ask about Raynaud's in particular), vasculitis, arthritis, lung disease - Occupational/environmental exposures: pets (birds), allergens, mold/stagnant water, asbestos, silica, coal, beryllium, heavy metals - Medications/Therapeutics: amiodarone, nitrofurantoin, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation - Smoking and smoke exposure Physical Exam: - Respiratory: fine, 'velcro-like' crackles that do not clear with cough suggest fibrosis; wheezing, rhonchi are atypical - Cardio: TR suggests pulmonary HTN - MSK: clubbing, joint swelling/tenderness/deformities - Skin: Raynaud's, sclerosis, rash Diagnostics: Imaging: - CXR: first study but not usually sensitive nor specific enough to diagnose, reticular infiltrates may be seen - CT non-contrast is best to evaluate the lung parenchyma. In particular, HRCT protocol (inspiratory and expiratory films in the supine and prone position) is the gold standard for diagnostic imaging - Supine vs prone imaging helps rule out atelectasis - Inspiratory vs expiratory cuts help to identify air trapping (seen as mosaicism worse with expiration) IIPs Pattern and Radiographic Features IIPs Pattern Radiographic features Clinical features Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) Septal thickening, Basilar and subpleural (peripheral) predominant fibrosis/ reticulation, honeycombing, and traction bronchiectasis/ bronchiectasis with minimal GGOs. Predominantly seen in IPF, but is also seen in many progressive fibrosing diseases, as well as radiation and chemo/immunotherapy induced ILDs. Generally this radiographic pattern progresses more quickly irrespective of the underlying cause. Non-Specific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP) Bilateral, Peri-bronchovascular predominant GGOs with subpleural sparing and most pronounced at the bases; increased reticular patterns, and mosaic attenuation due to air trapping. Minimal or absent honeycombing May be idiopathic, or secondary to medications or connective tissue diseases. Steroid responsive. Can coexist with UIP Acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP) Diffuse GGOs with consolidation and lobular sparing; radiologically indistinguishable from ARDS Rapid onset (7-10 days) fever, cough, SOB. High morbidity/mortality, usually presenting as ARDS. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) Patchy GGOs with consolidation most predominant in the periphery and at the bases; Subpleural and peribronchial multifocal migratory consolidations. Can present clinically with cough, DOE, malaise, fevers. Steroid-responsive (must rule out inciting process first by obtaining infectious workup, reviewing meds, radiation history, etc.) Smoking-related IIPs Pattern Radiographic features Clinical features Desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) Many have normal CXRs. Ground glass opacities without the peripheral reticular opacities characteristic of UIP Young current or former smokers with subacute dyspnea, wheezing and cough. In biopsy, intraluminal macrophages containing dusty light brown pigment. Good prognosis - reversible with smoking cessation. Respiratory bronchiolitis-associated ILD (RB-ILD) Bronchial thickening, centrilobular nodules, patchy GGOs; predominantly upper-lobe distribution Young current or former smokers with subacute dyspnea, wheezing and cough. In biopsy, intraluminal macrophages containing dusty light brown pigment. Good prognosis - reversible with smoking cessation. Secondary ILDs with Characteristic Imaging Findings Pattern Radiographic features Clinical features Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis Centrilobular nodules, mosaic air trapping in an upper lobe-predominant distribution Acute: flu-like symptoms, dyspnea without wheezing that subsides within hours to days after removal of inciting antigen. Chronic: insidious onset fatigue, cough, dyspnea, with bilateral rales Sarcoidosis Bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement; parenchymal involvement can present as reticulonodular opacities, nodules. Fibrosis will appear in late stages Highly variable disease manifestations. Typically sudden onset with spontaneous remission in the majority of patients Labs without Pulmonology consult: - ESR, CRP, ANA w/ reflex ENA, RF, CCP, C3, C4 - CBC with diff: evaluate eosinophilia or cytopenias concerning for autoimmune disease - CMP, CK, aldolase: to assess for other organ involvement, hypercalcemia (can be seen in sarcoid or other granulomatous disease) - RPP, sputum culture Labs in conjunction with Pulmonology: - Myositis panel: anti-synthetase syndrome commonly presents without muscle signs/symptoms, anti-Scl-70 and anti-RNP - Hypersensitivity pneumonitis panel: (needs to be sent to a highly specialized lab for crucial immunoprecipitation technique) - Histo antigen, blasto antigen, aspergillus galactomannan, 1-3-\u03b2-D-glucan, sputum GMS; consider NTM and HIV PFTs: usually restrictive lung disease +/- low DLCO - Spirometry: expect to see \u2193 FEV1 and FVC with FEV1/FVC >0.7 - Body Plethysmography: \u2193 TLC, RV, and/or FRC - Sarcoidosis can present as obstructive, restrictive, or mixed pattern - DLCO: Usually low and monitored for disease progression Bronchoscopy and biopsy: - BAL is not diagnostic ILD: may help rule out infection and understand the underlying inflammatory response - Consider when there is diagnostic uncertainty or concern for superimposed infection - Surgical lung biopsy is gold standard but often patients too sick to tolerate - Transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) is usually nondiagnostic in ILD outside of sarcoidosis or HP. Cryobiopsy can be considered an alternative to surgical lung biopsy for histopathology. Other tests to consider: - 6-minute walk test: prognostic value - TTE to evaluate for pHTN - SLP evaluation for indolent aspiration Management Acute exacerbation (AE-ILD) - Diagnostic criteria: known diagnosis of ILD, clinical decline within 1 month duration, CT evidence of new/worsening bilateral GGO and/or consolidation superimposed on a background pattern consistent with the ILD, NOT due to another cause - Chest CT is imaging standard - Important to distinguish between infection and ILD flare \u2013 where bronchoscopy can be particularly helpful - Rule out worsening respiratory status due to identifiable cause (heart failure, infection, PE), support with supplemental O2 - Discontinue any potentially contributory medications - Empiric antibiotics are generally a good idea while ruling out infection; for patients on IS, empiric coverage of PJP should be considered - If infection ruled out, pulse-dose steroids followed by a prolonged taper is recommended although response is subtype dependent and often limited. This should be done under pulmonary guidance - Don't make changes to IS without pulm/rheum input - Often patients require ICU care due to oxygen requirements, important to discuss GOC and Code Status each hospitalization - ECMO, intubation with mechanical ventilation can be a bridge to transplant Chronic Therapy Antifibrotics Main utility is in IPF; can be used for fibrosis due to any etiology Nintedanib (Ofev): Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor - INBUILD & INPULSIS trials: decreases rate of decline in FVC, no reduction on mortality - Adverse effects: abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, weight loss, elevated AST and ALT Pirfenidone: TGF-B inhibitor - RELIEF & ASCEND trials: May slow rate of decline of DLCO and 6MWT distance, no mortality reduction - Adverse effects: GI discomfort and photosensitivity Immunosuppression MUST rule out infection prior to use Generally use mycophenolate and azathioprine; can also use cyclophosphamide, rituximab, and calcineurin inhibitors Steroid/immunosuppression responsive (generally): COP, NSIP (cellular subtype), CTILD, inflammatory HP, sarcoidosis, vasculitis-associated ILDs Not usually steroid responsive: IPF, fibrotic HP For AE-ILD, steroids may still be given as a last resort Other Considerations Smoking cessation and exposure elimination are paramount Drug removal: consider discontinuing amiodarone, checkpoint inhibitor, etc Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: antigen exposure elimination Eosinophilic pneumonia: steroids; biologics can be used (send to Allergy clinic) Consider lung transplant eval for progressive or rapidly decompensating fibrotic lung disease Pulmonary rehabilitation is crucial (trend towards mortality benefit) Lung Masses Author: Sybil Watkins, Chandler Montgomery Background Definitions Lesion < 3 cm = pulmonary nodule Lesion > 3 cm = lung mass Pulmonary nodules are common and often benign, but presence of lung mass (>3cm) should prompt workup as chance of malignancy is high (>50%) Refer to \"Pulmonary Nodule\" chapter Differential Diagnosis Malignant - Primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): adenocarcinoma (~40%), squamous cell (SCC, ~20%), large cell carcinoma (~5%) - Metastatic: commonly melanoma, sarcoma, colon, breast, renal, testicular - Often multiple nodules/masses (e.g. cannonball) - Neuroendocrine: small cell lung cancer (SCLC, ~15%), carcinoid, large cell neuroendocrine Infectious - Granulomatous: TB, non-TB mycobacterium, endemic fungal (histo, blasto, coccidio) - May have component of calcification - Abscess: Staph aureus, Klebsiella, anaerobes, polymicrobial (aspiration) - Septic emboli, hydatid cyst, aspergilloma Other - Hamartoma, AVM, pulmonary infarct, inflammatory nodule (GPA, RA), sarcoidosis Evaluation History Smoking, cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, chest pain, weight loss, fevers, night sweats, hoarseness (recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement), bone pain, FND, Horner's syndrome Lung cancer should always be considered in a pt with recurrent pneumonia (post-obstructive) or smoking history with new cough or hemoptysis Exam Cachexia, LAD, bone pain, hepatomegaly, FND, SVC syndrome, digital clubbing Imaging CXR - Poor sensitivity for lung nodules, may show large mass or malignant effusion CT chest (with contrast if possible\u2014better evaluation of mediastinum/LNs) - Review prior chest imaging to assess age and growth pattern of lesion(s) - Benign features: small (sub-centimeter), calcified, fat attenuation, stable over 2 years, multiple nodules - Concerning features: large, growth, spiculation, upper lobe location, thick-walled cavitation, mediastinal invasion - Location: adenocarcinoma often more peripheral, SCC often more central, SCLC associated with massive LAD, mediastinal invasion, and large hilar masses Look for Paraneoplastic Syndromes SCLC: SIADH, Lambert-Eaton, Cushing's syndrome SCC: hypercalcemia (PTHrP) Dermatomyositis, polymyositis, hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (periostitis of long bones) Marantic endocarditis Hypercoagulability leading to venous thromboembolism Staging/Diagnosis Imaging - CT chest (with contrast if possible) and CTAP w/contrast vs. PET/CT to assess for metastasis - Consider MRI brain if clinical stage III or IV disease Biopsy: careful planning is key - For metastatic disease, obtain tissue from least invasive site - FNA or excision of palpable lymph node (cytology dept, US-guided procedure, EGS) - Pleural effusion: thoracentesis w/ cytology might provide initial info (sensitivity ~60%) - If uncertain how to best obtain tissue, consult IR, interventional pulm, and/or oncology to discuss approach - Surgical Bx: Wedge resection/lobectomy often preferred if solitary nodule amenable to both diagnostic and therapeutic resection in good surgical candidate - Bronchoscopy with EBUS (endobronchial US) often used to obtain biopsy of mediastinal tissue or central/peri-bronchial lesion - Navigational bronchoscopy: allows for more precise maneuvering of scope/instrument into the periphery of the lungs under direct visualization while ensuring stability during sampling of target lesions; increased diagnostic yield - Trans-thoracic needle aspiration (TTNA): peripheral lesions not amenable to bronchoscopy Management NSCLC: Planning is complex, usually discussed at multidisciplinary tumor board - Stage I/II: surgical resection \u00b1 adjuvant chemotherapy - Stage III: more complex requiring multidisciplinary approach, typically combined chemoradiotherapy specifically with immunotherapy agents - Stage IV: chemo \u00b1 targeted therapy depending on PD-L1 expression, presence of driver mutations for EGFR, ALK, ROS-1, BRAF, MET, RET, others SCLC - Usually widely metastatic at time of diagnosis (~70%), treated with systemic chemo/radiation specifically with immunotherapy agents Lung Nodule Author: David Krasinski Background Definition: focal, distinct radiographic density completely surrounded by lung tissue <3cm (mass >3cm \u2013 see \"Lung Mass\" chapter) Prevalence: 30% of all chest CTs. Most commonly are incidentalomas. >95% are benign. Larger and irregularly shaped nodules are more likely to be malignant. Etiologies CT Pattern Pathology Etiologies Random: hematogenous spread Infections Miliary TB, septic emboli Malignancy Sarcomas, carcinomas Other Langerhans cell histiocytosis Centrilobular: most diseases that track airways Infectious Granulomas from fungi, mycobacteria, prior bacterial infx (nocardia/S. aureus) Inflammatory Aspiration, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchogenic cyst Malignancy Bronchogenic carcinomas (central: SCC, small-cell), peripheral (adenoCa, large cell) Peri lymphatic: lymph system spread Inflammatory Sarcoidosis, pneumoconiosis Malignant Lymphangitic carcinomatosis, lymphoma, metastatic sarcomas/carcinomas Benign Hamartomas, fibromas, hemangiomas, leiomyomas, amyloidoma (Please refer to physical handbook for radiographic image associated with the above table) Management of Solitary Lung Nodule History Hx of exposures (tobacco, asbestos, mining, biomass fuel), geographical epidemiology (histo/coccidio/TB), B-symptoms, personal and FxHx of malignancy Assess Patient Risk for Malignancy High risk: - Greater than 60yo, current smoker or heavy smoking history, history of cancer, FxHx lung cancer, irregular or spiculated, upper lobe, \u22652.3cm, double diameter or volume in past year - There are online risk calculators (Brock, Mayo, Herder) helpful for providers who are not experts in lung nodule risk stratification Benign imaging features: - Central calcification, popcorn-like (hamartomas), laminated, stippled Consider Pulmonary referral if: - High risk features, known malignancy or recent history of malignancy, organ transplant or other immunocompromising condition, age <35yo Fleischner Guidelines for Nodules <8mm Risk for Malignancy Solid <6mm Solid 6-8mm Solid \u22658mm Subsolid (GGO \u00b1 solid component) Low No follow-up CT at 6-12mo and consider at 18-24mo Refer to Pulm.

ACCP 2013 Chest Guidelines for Workup of Nodules 8-30mm Low to Moderate Surgical Risk: - Assess clinical probability of cancer: - Very low (<5%) : CT surveillance - Low/mod (5-65%) : PET to assess nodule - Negative or mild uptake: CT surveillance OR nonsurgical biopsy - Mod or intense uptake: nonsurgical biopsy or surgical resection - High (>65%) : Standard stage eval (\u00b1PET) - No met: Surgical resection or SBRT or RFA - +Met (N2, 3): chemotherapy or chemoradiation (after biopsy) High Surgical Risk: - Nonsurgical biopsy OR CT surveillance - Malignant: Standard stage eval (\u00b1PET) - No met: Surgical resection or SBRT or RFA - +Met (N2, 3): chemotherapy or chemoradiation (after biopsy) - Nondiagnostic: CT surveillance - Specific Benign: Specific treatment Pleural Effusions Author: David Krasinski Background There is a normal influx of fluid into the pleural space due to leaky capillary membranes and the pleural space's negative pressure. This fluid is constantly reabsorbed by lymphatics. An imbalance in the system will result in accumulation. Examples of Dysfunction in Homeostasis Increased influx : \u2191 filtration from the capillaries from high intravascular hydrostatic pressure (e.g. heart failure, renal failure) or low intravascular oncotic pressure Other liquid entry into the pleural space through anatomic deficits: CSF, chyle, urine, blood, ascites (the diaphragm is naturally porous) Decreased efflux : obstruction of the parietal pleural stoma (from protein or cellular debris in exudative pleural effusions) Increased systemic venous pressure : lymphatic system drains into the systemic venous circulation so high venous pressure prevents lymphatics from draining appropriately Presentation May be asymptomatic Chest pain : usually pleuritic via parietal pleural innervation Dyspnea and tachypnea without hypoxia (unless concurrent airspace disease): Dyspnea is thought to be mediated by branches of the phrenic n. that are under pressure from effusion Exam : \u2193 breath sounds, \u2193 chest wall excursion, \u2193 tactile fremitus, dullness to percussion Evaluation CXR: Ideally supine AP, lateral upright and decubitus lateral - Fluid accumulates first in subpulmonic space and then in posterior costophrenic recess - 50cc: Visible in posterior costophrenic angle on lateral film - 200cc: Visible on AP costophrenic angle on AP film - 500cc: Obliteration of hemidiaphragm - If effusion moves with gravity, suggests free flowing POCUS: assess size, location, loculations CT with contrast: not always indicated; helpful to evaluate septations Thoracentesis: see \"Procedures section\" Interpretation of Pleural Studies Obtain: - Pleural LDH, protein, cell count/diff, gram stain w/ culture, pH - Consider pleural cytology, hematocrit, triglyceride, glucose, and amylase - Need serum LDH and protein Light's Criteria 1 of the following to be considered an exudative effusion: - Pleural to serum protein ratio > 0.5 - Pleural to serum LDH ratio > 0.6 - Pleural LDH > 2/3 upper limit of normal range of serum LDH Transudative: CHF exacerbation, hepatic hydrothorax, atelectasis (caused by increased intrapleural negative pressure), hypoalbuminemia, renal failure Exudative: infections (bacterial, TB, fungal), malignant, rheumatologic, PE Hemothorax: pleural hematocrit >50% of blood hematocrit Chylothorax: pleural TG >100mg/dl Concern for esophageal rupture: elevated salivary amylase Other Tips Protein : >5 think TB or malignancy, <0.5 think urine, CSF, peritoneal dialysate Glucose : <60 think about malignancy, TB, or rheumatologic, less likely hemothorax or parapneumonic Cell count/diff : polys represent an acute process, monocytes represent a chronic process, lymphocytes think about TB or malignancy, eosinophils think about air/blood, TB, malignancy, asbestos, drugs Two separate processes may co-occur, and a transudate may mask an exudative effusion; if concerned for this and you have clinical stability, trial diuresis prior to thoracentesis Management Parapneumonic effusion: most common exudative process - Uncomplicated : systemic antibiotic for pneumonia - Complicated (positive culture or gram stain, OR loculated OR pH<7.20 OR glucose less than 60): needs chest tube + MIST2 protocol (intrapleural alteplase 10 mg BID in 30 mL of saline AND intrapleural DNase 5 mg BID in 30 mL of water for a total of 3 days) Hepatic hydrothorax: - Avoid chest tubes. Cirrhosis medical management \u00b1 TIPS. - Spontaneous bacterial empyema might occur. Perform thoracentesis if suspected. Tuberculosis effusions: - Treat as active TB. Often resolves with treatment. Malignant pleural effusion: - If cytology isolates malignant cells in pleural space, this often automatically classifies that malignancy as an advanced/metastatic stage. Tends to recur. - If recurrent, either do 1) serial thoracentesis, 2) PleurX catheter (tunneled chest tube) or 3) chemical pleurodesis (obliteration of pleural space with talc or tetracycline) Pulmonary Hypertension Author: Jessica Reed Classification WHO Group Pathophysiology Etiologies Group 1. Pulmonary arterial hypertension Proliferation and hyperplasia of vascular wall leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance Idiopathic, heritable (BMPR2 mutation), drug-induced/toxin-induced (methamphetamine, Fen-Phen), connective tissue disease (scleroderma), HIV, portal HTN, congenital heart disease (ASD, VSD, PDA), schistosomiasis (#1 cause of PAH worldwide), Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD), Pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis Group 2.

Lung diseases or chronic hypoxemia Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction leads to vascular bed remodeling COPD, ILD, OSA, chronic high-altitude exposure, developmental lung disorders, chronic alveolar hypoventilation Group 4. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) Chronic pulmonary embolism. Incomplete fibrinolysis and organization of thrombus Thrombotic and non-thrombotic emboli (parasites, foreign bodies, tumor) Group 5. Multifactorial Varied Hematologic disorders (sickle cell disease), chronic hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis, fibrosing mediastinitis, ESRD Presentation Symptoms: - Exertional dyspnea, presyncope, fatigue, exertional chest pain, edema, syncope (concern for severe PH) Physical Exam Findings: - JVD, RV Heave, Widely split S2, tricuspid regurg murmur, Hepatomegaly, ascites, rales (pulmonary edema), LE edema Presentation can be variable and depends on group, underlying etiology and functional class at time of presentation. Main chief complaint for admission: volume overload secondary to RV failure and/or hypoxia Evaluation Labs: - CBC with diff (assess for anemia, polycythemia), BNP, CMP, blood gas to assess for chronic hypercarbia - If suspected but undiagnosed: TSH, HIV, rheumatologic serologies (ANA w/reflex ENA, RF/CCP, ANCA, Scl-70, Ro/La) Imaging: - CXR : Possible Cardiac enlargement, PA dilation, hilar fullness - TTE with bubble : RVSP >35-40 is concerning for PH. TTE can show evidence of RV dilation and dysfunction (TAPSE <1.6cm), RA dilation, septal flattening, pericardial effusion, bubble study for shunt, LV dysfunction - CT angiogram : evaluates for acute and chronic thrombi using contrast media; consider V/Q scan in setting of AKI and advanced CKD (discuss risk and benefits) - V/Q scan : better performance in evaluating small chronic embolism in contrast to CTA - High-res CT : for better evaluation of lung parenchyma in patients with ILD Additional Testing: - EKG : right atrial enlargement (peaked P waves), RBBB, RV hypertrophy - 6-min walk test : important for prognostication, baseline exertional capacity, and to evaluate treatment response - PFT : rule out obstructive and restrictive disease; isolated DLCO reduction can be seen with PAH - Sleep study : evaluation for chronic hypoxemia from OSA; if low suspicion for OSA/CSA, can start with overnight oximetry - RHC (see below) Diagnosis and Diagnostic Algorithm Clinical Suspicion of PH (see presentation) Initial Non-Invasive Testing (TTE, CXR, Labs, PFTs, EKG) Further Imaging (CT Chest/V/Q scan) Referral to PH Center* Confirmatory Testing (RHC is diagnostic) Additional Tests May be suspected from clinical presentation and echo A right heart catheterization is the gold standard for PH diagnosis and will differentiate between precapillary and postcapillary PH Nitric oxide challenge during RHC assesses for drug response Fluid challenge with 500ml LR during RHC assesses left heart compliance Referral to PH Center is particularly recommended for suspected PAH (Group 1), CTEPH (Group 4), or severe PH with RV dysfunction RHC: required for diagnosis and to determine therapeutic options; measures mPAP, PWP, PVR, CO, CI - Acute vasoreactivity testing (AVT) - Nitric oxide challenge during RHC assesses for drug response and possible therapeutic options - Positive: mPAP decreases by \u226510 mmHg and mPAP reaches \u226440 mmHg, no decrease in cardiac output - Fluid challenge with 500ml LR during RHC assesses left heart compliance - Negative Fluid Challenge: PCWP remains \u226415 mmHg Definitions Characteristics Causes Pre-capillary PH mPAP > 20 mmHg, PWP \u226415 mmHg, PVR \u22652 WU Groups 1, 3, 4, 5 Post-capillary PH mPAP > 20 mmHg, PWP > 15 mmHg, PVR < 2 WU Group 2 Combined pre- and post-capillary PH mPAP > 20 mmHg, PWP > 15 mmHg, PVR \u22652 WU Group 2, 5 General Management Immunizations : Strong recommendations for yearly influenza, COVID-19, and pneumococcal vaccinations Pregnancy Counseling : recommend patients avoid pregnancy due to high maternal and fetal risks (RH failure, increased mortality) Treatment Goals : Focus on preventing right heart failure, maximizing PH therapies, symptom relief, quality of life, and functional class improvement (NYHA class) Oxygenation Goal : Maintain oxygen saturation >90% Volume/Hemodynamic Management : try to avoid giving fluids, especially if significant RV dysfunction as this is more likely to throw off Frank-Starling curve than overdiuresis Classic teaching of pre-load dependence is more accurate for acute RV dysfunction than chronic and diuresis is often warranted during episodes of RHF Specialist Consultation : Consult pulmonary hypertension specialists when considering starting, holding, or changing PH medications; Do not change therapy at VUMC without PH consult Regular Follow-Up : Q3-6M visits, assessment of NYHA functional Class for treatment escalation, serial echocardiograms, 6minute walk and RHC if clinically indicated Disease Specific Therapeutics and Interventions Therapy MOA/Rationale Patient Population/Considerations Oral CCBs (Nifedipine, diltiazem, amlodipine) Induce vasodilation by inhibiting calcium influx in pulmonary artery smooth muscle, promoting muscle relaxation Used ONLY in pts w/ Group 1 PH who had a positive vasoreactivity challenge on RHC as above Anticoagulation (DOAC, VKA) Prevent new thrombus formation and promoting the resolution of any existing acute thrombi For pts with confirmed CTEPH (Group 4). Should be worked up for hypercoagulability including antiphospholipid syndrome. PAH-specific medications (in order of escalation) Therapy MOA/Rationale Patient Population/Considerations Endothelin receptor antagonists (e.g., bosentan, ambrisentan, macitentan) Block endothelin-1 receptors, reducing vasoconstriction and proliferation See notes 1, 2, 3 below. Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil) Inhibit PDE-5, increasing cGMP levels and promoting vasodilation See notes 1, 2, 3 below. Prostacyclin analogs (e.g., epoprostenol, treprostinil) Mimic prostacyclin, leading to vasodilation and inhibition of platelet aggregation See notes 1, 2, 3 below. Prostacyclin receptor agonists (e.g., selexipag) Activate prostacyclin receptors, causing vasodilation See notes 1, 2, 3 below. Soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators (e.g., riociguat) Stimulate sGC, increasing cGMP independent of nitric oxide leading to vasodilation See notes 1, 2, 3 below. Sotatercept An activin receptor type IIA-Fc fusion protein, works by binding to free activins, restoring balance between the activin proliferative and BMP antiproliferative pathways in the pulmonary arteries Used as add on therapy in Group 1 PH to enhance exercise capacity, improve functional class, and reduce clinical worsening All therapies given under the direction of PH specialist. Important Notes on Prostacyclin Based Therapies: Side effects include jaw pain, flushing, arthralgias, and diarrhea. IV formulations are administered through a continuous pump. Never stop IV prostacyclin therapy inpatient since even brief pauses can cause rebound vasoconstriction and death. Epoprostenol: IV (Veletri) or inhaled (Flolan); half-life 4 minutes. Treprostinil: IV/subcutaneous/inhaled/PO; half-life 4 hours Selexipag (Uptravi): PO, half-life hours Treatment escalation is based on a pt's risk stratification Procedural Considerations Atrial septostomy : creation of a R\u2192L shunt to offload the RV VA ECMO can be used as bridge to medical therapy or for lung transplant Lung transplantation can be considered for pts who are candidates and failing maximal medical therapy Poor Prognostic Factors NYHA Functional Class III and IV : Indicates severe symptoms and significant limitations in physical activity 6-minute walk test less than 300 meters : correlates with worse functional capacity and right ventricular dysfunction AKI and/or hyponatremia : AKI and hyponatremia are markers of severe right heart failure and systemic congestion, indicating poor renal perfusion and neurohormonal activation, both of which are associated with increased mortality Low SBP (SBP < 90) : reflects poor cardiac output and advanced right ventricular failure Poor hemodynamics on RHC (right atrial pressure > 20 mmHg; cardiac index less than 2) TTE findings : tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE, marker of global RV function) < 1.8, pericardial effusion, and severe RV dysfunction Airway Clearance Therapy Author: Jacob Lee Definition: A variety of noninvasive techniques designed to mobilize and remove secretions to improve gas exchange and work of breathing (American Association for Respiratory Care) By expelling mucous and secretions, airway clearance therapy (ACT) aims to decrease airway inflammation, prevent obstruction and subsequent atelectasis and infection and thereby improve gas exchange and respiratory symptoms All ACTs aim to make cough more productive Uses In general, ACT is used for pathologies that cause retained secretions, mucous plugging due to overproduction or impaired mucociliary clearance Indications Cystic fibrosis Non-CF bronchiectasis COPD with chronic sputum production or recurrent infections Recurrent aspiration/aspiration pneumonia Neuromuscular diseases involving the respiratory muscles Prolonged ventilator-dependence/ventilator weaning Contraindications Hemodynamically unstable Hemoptysis PTX Recent lung surgery or trauma Components Therapy Description Order Set Comments Chest Physiotherapy (CPT) Patient assumes sequence of positions aimed at \"draining\" each of the lobes of the lung by gravity. Usually combined with percussion or vibration techniques CPPD Panel (RT Bronchial Hygiene Protocol) \u2013 usually TID Done with RT. Better tolerated than vest physiotherapy, can be combined with a percussive/vibratory device such as a wand High Frequency Chest Wall Compression (HFCWC) \u2013 'Vest Physiotherapy' An inflatable vest with a compressor rapidly inflates and deflates vest to \"break up\" thickened mucus from airway wall. Can target specific areas depending on the vest Vest Physiotherapy Usually done with RT. Vest can be uncomfortable and difficult to tolerate particularly for elderly/frail patients- in which case can use a 'wand' Positive Expiratory Pressure (PEP) Patient exhales against fixed or fluttering resistor that allows air to get behind mucus, helps move mucus from airway walls, and holds airways open longer for improved ventilation PEP Therapy or Oscillatory PEP Therapy Also commonly called Flutter valve, Acapella, AerobikA. Can find these in any RT station and bring it to the patient Cough Assist Via mask or trach/vent connection \u2013 applies positive pressure to fill the lungs, then quickly switches to negative pressure to produce a high expiratory flow rate to simulate a cough that is intended to produce expectorant Cough Assist Treatment Panel Most effective in patients with neuromuscular weakness affecting diaphragmatic strength \u2013 muscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis, spinal cord lesions, SMA Adjuncts Not technically considered ACT but can improve cough productivity Mucolytics: Dornase Alfa, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), Hypertonic Saline (3-7%) - Hypertonic saline can cause bronchospasm and can be poorly tolerated, consider combining with DuoNebs either before or after Expectorants: Guaifenesin Considerations CF patients typically have a routine that involves CPT, vest physiotherapy, and PEP valve in addition to their inhaler therapies, ask them their home routine, then ask the CF team if it should be more aggressive (increased frequency) Chest Tubes Author: Jacob Lee Background Nomenclature Size Insertion Technique Specific Indications Small Bore - Straight or Pigtail (coiled at the end to prevent dislodgement) \u226414F Seldinger PTX, uncomplicated pleural effusions, initial empyema drainage (BTS guidelines) Medium-Bore 15-23F Seldinger or Surgical Larger pleural effusions or complex/exudative effusions Large-Bore (Surgical) 24-40F Surgical Thoracostomy Post-operative drainage, hemothorax, thick exudative effusions Other Indications and Considerations Malignant effusions and hepatic hydrothorax are generally palliative measures only Large-bore/surgical chest tube should be placed for acute hemothorax, not pigtail Smaller size results in less tissue disruption but more likely to clog or kink Contraindications Absolute: need for emergent thoracotomy Relative: Coagulopathy (INR Goal < 2-3 depending on proceduralist comfortability), large pulmonary bullae, pleural/pulmonary adhesions, skin infection at insertion site Placement Consult pulmonology \u2013 they will decide whether interventional pulmonology/radiology needs to place the tube Location: related to pathology - Pneumothorax - anterior near the apex of the lung in the 2nd intercostal space, midaxillary line - Effusion (water, pus, blood, chyle) \u2013 depends on where the fluid is located but in general placed posterior near the base of the lung (fifth or sixth intercostal space, midaxillary line) Potential complications: organ damage/perforation (lung, heart, diaphragm, intraabdominal), trauma of the intercostal neurovascular bundle, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, infection, re-expansion pulmonary edema Understanding the Atrium After the chest tube is placed, it is connected to the Atrium which can be connected to the wall for suction. Please refer to the physical handbook for the diagram which is described below. (A) Dry suction control - determines the level of suction out of the chest tube and is set by the provider (typically -20 cm H2O). It is important to note that while the atrium is linked to the wall suction via suction port (H) the level of chest tube suction is determined by (A), regardless of what the wall suction setting is (B) Water seal chamber - if the atrium is disconnected from the wall suction, it is on \"water seal\" (i.e., to gravity). This allows for the one-way flow of pleural space contents out of the chest. This space also shows 'tidaling' in certain instances explained below (C) Air leak monitor - if air bubbles are present in the water seal chamber, then that indicates the presence of air in the pleural space (D) Collection chamber - drains the pleural fluid contents via the chest tube (E) Suction verification window - will be orange if suction is on and atrium is functioning appropriately Normal Findings and Troubleshooting Tidaling: a normal finding referring to the rise (during inspiration) and fall (during expiration) of fluid in the water seal chamber - Indicates communication between pleural space and the drainage system and that the system is functioning correctly - Lack of tidaling can be seen in several instances: lung has fully re-expanded, chest tube is blocked (clogged/kinked), suction is turned on, or tube is dislodged/mispositioned Output in the absence of pathology can be up to roughly 150 cc/day which is the amount of fluid the pleural space produces daily In general, CXR is first study to order in evaluating a patient with a chest tube who undergoes a change in clinical status Air leaks: If bubbles are present in the water seal chamber, this indicates air in the pleural space. Intermittent bubbling is common in a PTX while air is still escaping from the pleural space. Continuous bubbling suggests an ongoing air leak. Two main categories of air leaks: - Patient-related/originating from pleural space : Persistent air in the pleural space; seen in alveolar-pleural fistula, PTX (expected initially; should decrease over time as lung re-expands), mechanical ventilation - System-Related/chest tube or drainage system : Air not originating from pleural space but the system; seen in chest tube dislodgement, faulty dressing seal at insertion site, cracked or damaged drain system To identify the etiology of a new air leak, try clamping the chest tube: - Clamp near patient and bubbling stops \u2192 leak in pleural space - Clamp near patient and bubbling continues \u2192 leak in the drainage system or tubing Clogging: Would see debris in the collection chamber and lack of tidaling in the water seal chamber - In pts with viscous fluid output (ex- empyema), important to flush the chest tube with normal saline flushes at least twice daily to prevent clogging - For clog- try flushing 10cc of sterile saline toward the pt or \"stripping\" the chest tube by pressing the chest tube with your fingers and pulling towards the drainage system - Always consult pulmonary for chest tube management unless another team (eg, thoracics) is actively managing Removal Generally, chest tubes are removed when the underlying condition requiring their insertion has plateaued, improved, or resolved - Effusions : less than 150 cc in 24 hours - PTX : step wise approach. Usually once air leak resolves, will transition from wall suction to water seal with a CXR prior to transitioning and prior to removal. Generally guided by the team that placed the tube Chest tube should be removed while pt hums (to prevent inhalation during removal that could introduce air into pleural space). Pigtail catheters must be \"unlocked\" prior to removal to release the pigtail Home Oxygen Therapies Author: Mackenzie Samson Summary of Medicare Part B Guidelines for Home Oxygen Conditions for which oxygen therapy may be covered Severe lung disease including COPD and ILD, CF, bronchiectasis, widespread neoplasms Hypoxia related symptoms or findings expected to improve with O2: pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, erythrocytosis, impaired cognition, nocturnal restlessness, morning headache Qualifying Tests and Requirements Testing must be performed with a pt in chronic stable condition or within two days of discharge from an inpt hospital stay (after treatment of acute exacerbating conditions) Criteria: Resting SpO2 \u226488% (or PaO2 <55) or SpO2 <88% with ambulation Must be documented in chart Special Considerations Medicare requires an additional walk on 4L/min showing desaturation if the pt needs a flow rate of 5L/min or higher Because of the risk of desaturation with exertion and the intrinsic error in the pulse ox (around 3%), pts with resting SpO2 \u226492% should have amb sats checked Pts with Raynaud's or poor circulation may have inaccurate finger pulse oximeter readings. Consider using a head saturation monitor VA Specific Guidance Will need to document ambulatory saturations in notes as above. Call the Oxygen Clinic (number listed in all team rooms) and talk with your case manager Summary of Medicare Part C Guidelines for Home Respiratory Assist Devices (CPAP/BiPAP) Restrictive thoracic disorders Covered if the following criteria are met: - Documentation of a neuromuscular disease/severe thoracic cage abnormality AND one of the following: - PaCO2 \u226545 mmHg on ABG, performed while awake and on home O2 requirement - Sleep oximetry demonstrates oxygen saturation \u226488% for \u22655 minutes of nocturnal recording time performed while on home O2 requirement - For a neuromuscular disease (only), either: Maximal inspiratory pressure < 60cm H2O or forced vital capacity < 50% predicted and COPD may not contribute significantly Severe COPD Covered if the following criteria are met: - PaCO2 \u226552 mmHg on ABG, performed while awake and on pt's prescribed home O2 - Sleep oximetry demonstrates oxygen saturation \u226488% for \u22655 minutes of nocturnal recording time, performed while breathing oxygen at 2LPM or pt's prescribed FiO2 (whichever is higher). Also requires that OSA had been considered and ruled out (formal sleep testing not required) Hypoventilation Syndrome Covered if criteria 1, 2, AND either 3 or 4 are met: 1. PaCO2 \u226545 mmHg on ABG, performed while awake and on home O2 requirement, AND 2. Spirometry shows an FEV1/FVC \u226570% AND 3. ABG PaCO2, performed during sleep or immediately upon awakening that demonstrates worsening PaCO2 of \u22657 mmHg compared to the original result in criterion 1 OR 4. A facility-based PSG or HST demonstrates oxygen saturation \u226488% for \u22655 minutes of nocturnal recording time that is not caused by obstructive upper airway events OSA An initial screening for OSA in the hospital is nocturnal pulse oximetry. The distinct \"saw-tooth\" pattern representing intermittent hypoxia is suggestive of OSA, and a formal NPSG or home sleep test is recommended to evaluate for OSA. This is done on an outpt basis only once acute issues have fully resolved Home CPAP/BiPAP covered IF: The diagnosis of central sleep apnea or complex sleep apnea and Significant improvement of the sleep-associated hypoventilation occurs with the use of the device Inhaler Therapy Author: Jacob Lee Current Inhaler Device Delivery Options Device Mechanism Pros Cons Examples Metered dose inhaler (MDI) Pressurized canister releases a measured dose of aerosolized medication Delivers precise & consistent doses when used correctly. Can be used with spacer Requires hand-breath coordination (timing 3-5 seconds slow inhalation with 5-10 seconds breath hold with release of medicine) Albuterol, Fluticasone (Flovent), Ipratropium (Atrovent), Budesonide/Formoterol (Symbicort) Soft mist inhaler (SMI) Uses a mechanical spring to generate slow-moving mist that is inhaled without a propellant Releases a mist that lasts longer and is slower than MDIs. Better lung deposition than MDI. Easier to use for patients with poor coordination Typically more expensive and less options. Must be primed if not used frequently. Tiotropium (Spiriva Respimat), Ipratropium/Albuterol (Combivent) Dry powder inhaler (DPI) Delivers a fine powder of medication when inhaling without a propellant Environmentally friendly (no HFA \u2013 propellants). Breath actuated (no need for coordination) Relies on patients inspiratory effort which needs to be strong to get adequate lung deposition. Inconsistent dose delivery Fluticasone (Arnuity Ellipta, Flovent Diskus), Salmeterol/Fluticasone (Advair Diskus), Umeclidium/Vilanterol (Anoro Ellipta), Budesonide (Pulmicort), Trelegy Nebulizer Converts a liquid medication into a fine mist, allowing it to be inhaled using a mask or mouthpiece Does not require deep inhalation effort or coordination.

Ex: formoterol (shortest acting LABA), salmeterol, olodaterol - LABA monotherapy for asthma should be avoided due to increased risk for mortality Anticholinergics: block M3 receptors in airway smooth muscle leading to both bronchodilation and decreased bronchial secretions - Short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMA) : ipratropium (Atrovent) - Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) : tiotropium (Spiriva), revefenacin (Yupelri) - Indicated for COPD, not generally indicated for asthma unless part of a combination inhaler for exacerbation or triple therapy for maintenance for refractory disease COPD and asthma exacerbation: bronchodilation and secretion inhibition in acute setting - Ipratropium (Atrovent) intermittent nebulizer or Ipratropium-albuterol (Duo-Neb) intermittent or continuous nebulizer Corticosteroids Suppress airway inflammation - NOT bronchodilators - Budesonide inhaler (Pulmicort) or neb, fluticasone furoate (Arnuity Ellipta) Combination Therapies Combine beta-2 agonists, antimuscarinics, and/or corticosteroids. Generally better to combine multiple medications in a single inhaler rather than each individually (improved outcomes likely related to compliance) - SABA/SAMA : albuterol/ipratropium available as nebulizer (DuoNeb) or MDI (Combivent) - SABA/ICS : albuterol/budesonide (AirSupra) - LABA/ICS : only way to get LABA due to aforementioned increased mortality in LABA monotherapy; vilanterol-fluticasone (Breo Ellipta), salmeterol-fluticasone (Advair Diskus/HFA) - LAMA/LABA : umeclidinium/vilanterol (Anoro) - LABA/LAMA/ICS : triple therapy for refractory COPD/asthma. Formoterol/glycopyrrolate/budesonide (Breztri \u2013 now available inpatient as an MDI), vilanterol/umeclidinium/fluticasone (Trelegy \u2013 only outpatient as a DPI) Airway Clearance Agents Expectorants: Hypertonic saline, NS, 3% and 7% - Can be used to thin secretions and produce deep cough in pts who need to expectorate as part of treatment. For CF, chronic tracheostomy, NM weakness. No evidence for benefit in COPD Mucolytics: - Enzymatic Agents (Dornase alpha/Pulmozyme/DNAse) : enzyme that breaks down polymerized DNA in high concentrations in CF airways; indicated specifically for CF pts - Disulfide disruptors (NAC/Mucomyst) : Sever disulfide bonds of glycoproteins in mucus, lowering its viscosity and making it more amenable to suction, expectoration Antibiotics Generally used in pts with CF, non-CF bronchiectasis for suppressive therapy, may be indicated for VAP as salvage therapy Tobramycin : only nebulized antibiotic available at VUMC Pentamidine : nebulized antibiotic for PJP prophylaxis, given monthly VUMC Inpatient Options SABA : Albuterol (Proventil/Ventolin/Proair) - MDI, neb, continuous aerosol available SABA/SAMA : Ipratropium-albuterol (Duo-Neb) - neb and continuous neb available LABA \u2013 only available in combination w/ ICS.

As with chest radiographs, use a systematic approach. Here are some important reminders: Positioning Supine films poorly evaluate for free air, but are fine for evaluating bowel gas pattern and tube positioning Upright (preferred) or left lateral decubitus are more sensitive for free air Lines/Tubes Enteric tubes come in two general types at VUH: NG/Suction (one radiopaque line) Dobhoff/Feeding (two radiopaque lines with an opaque tip) Enteric tubes should course midline inferior to the carina before taking a smooth rightward curve below the diaphragm and past the GE junction Ideally, the tip and terminal sidehole of an NG tube should be below and oriented away from the GEJ If post-pyloric placement is desired, the tube should terminate right of midline and resemble the \"C-loop\" of the duodenum NGT radiograph will not include the lower abdomen or upper chest, so cannot fully evaluate bowel gas pattern. If the NGT is in the patient but not seen on the film, confirm that it is not coiled in the oropharynx, esophagus, or airway (confirm with CXR if necessary) Bowel Small bowel should be <3 cm, Large <6 cm, Cecum <9 cm; however a normal abdominal plain film cannot rule out obstruction Presence of air in the rectum generally favors ileus rather than obstruction Some seek to quantify stool burden by abdominal plain film, but this is insensitive and without objective thresholds Pathologic Gas Look for lucency adjacent to straight, opaque structures including the diaphragm, liver, and falciform (football sign) - Subdiaphragmatic - Outlines the serosal border of bowel (Rigler sign) - Bowel wall shouldn't have gas (pneumatosis) - Liver gas can be pneumobilia (prior ERCP/stent) or portal venous gas (from ischemic bowel) Please refer to physical handbook page 525 for images of Rigler's (double wall) sign and Football sign Stones and Bones Kidney stones (Low dose CT Kidney Stone protocol is the preferred imaging modality for surveillance) Incidental rib fractures, spine compression deformities, pelvic/hip fractures Ingested foreign bodies Surgical clips, embolic coils Masses and Soft Tissue The paucity of bowel gas or abnormal contour of intraluminal bowel gas can suggest a soft tissue mass in the abdomen, though this is better evaluated on CT Kidney margins may be faintly visible, which is normal Bladder Foley projecting in right location? Please refer to physical handbook page 525 for image of abdominal X-ray with Dobhoff placement Basic Abdomen and Pelvis CT Interpretation Structured search pattern and frequent windowing are important for evaluation of various structures and organs in the abdomen and pelvis. Soft tissue window: for evaluation of solid organ and soft tissue structures Bone windows: to identify fractures or osseous lesions Lung windows: to evaluate lung bases. Also helpful for identifying intraperitoneal free air in the abdomen and pelvis. Example of Routine CT Abdomen Pelvis Search Pattern and Dictation Template: Lower Chest Lung bases: consolidation, aspiration, atelectasis Pleural effusion, pneumothorax Pericardial effusion Liver Assess morphology, enhancement, masses, abscesses, vascular abnormalities, trauma Please refer to physical handbook page 526 for associated liver image. Liver trauma: laceration, hematoma, hemorrhage - Laceration: irregular linear/branching areas of hypoattenuation - Hematoma: intermediate to hyperdense collection between liver parenchyma and capsule - Vascular injury - Active hemorrhage: typically hyperdense compared to normal parenchyma Gallbladder and Biliary Tract Evaluate for dense gallstones, surrounding fat stranding or fluid, dilated biliary ducts Pancreas Assess morphology, enhancement, lesions, ductal dilation, peripancreatic fluid or stranding. Please refer to physical handbook page 526 for associated pancreas image. Pancreatitis: two subtypes (interstitial edematous and necrotizing) - Parenchymal enlargement, alterations in attenuation, indistinct margins, surrounding fat stranding, lack of parenchymal enhancement suggests necrosis Spleen Size, enhancement, trauma Adrenal Glands Morphology, masses Kidneys and Ureters Renal size, morphology, enhancement, masses, hydronephrosis, hydroureter, renal or ureteral stones. Urolithiasis: distal obstructing ureteral calculus with upstream hydronephrosis Please refer to physical handbook page 526 for associated urolithiasis images. Pyelonephritis: wedge-like regions of parenchymal swelling and reduced enhancement relative to normal parenchyma - Complications: renal or perinephric abscess, renal papillary necrosis, emphysematous pyelonephritis (look for bubbly or linear streaks of gas, fluid collections with air-fluid levels) Please refer to physical handbook page 527 for associated pyelonephritis image. Urinary Bladder Not well assessed when decompressed. Assess for wall thickening, masses, intraluminal debris, periserosal fat stranding. Gastrointestinal Tract Morphology of distal esophagus and stomach, bowel caliber, wall thickness, masses, mural enhancement, stool burden, appendix Bowel obstruction: Dilated gas or fluid-filled loops of bowel (3-6-9 cm rule for upper limit of normal size for small bowel, colon, and cecum diameter), air-fluid levels, fecal matter in small bowel loops, transition point between dilated and collapsed loops of bowel Please refer to physical handbook page 527 for associated bowel obstruction image. Bowel perforation: assess for free air, pneumatosis, portal venous gas Pneumatosis intestinalis: Intramural bowel gas. Linear lucencies or rounded bubbly collections. - Can be life-threatening secondary to ischemia, obstruction, enteritis/colitis, organ transplantation - Can also be incidental and secondary to benign etiology, making clinical context crucial Please refer to physical handbook page 527 for associated pneumatosis intestinalis image. Diverticulitis: Pericolonic fat stranding, segmental bowel wall thickening, mural hyperenhancement. - Complicated diverticulitis: perforation (free air and fluid), abscess formation, fistula formation (usually a chronic complication) Appendicitis: - Base of appendix located between the ileocecal valve and apex of the cecum - Location of the tip of the appendix and length of the appendix are variable - Appendiceal dilatation (classically >6mm outer diameter), wall thickening and enhancement, intraluminal fluid, periappendiceal fat stranding, adjacent cecal thickening Peritoneum Free air, free fluid, fluid collections, peritoneal or omental nodularity/implants - Small volume of peritoneal fluid may be physiologic in female pts, particularly around menses - Fluid is generally hypodense. Hyperdense fluid may suggest hemoperitoneum, especially in context of trauma Vasculature Suboptimally assessed without intravenous contrast, best assessed with CT angiography - Portal, splenic, superior mesenteric veins: evaluate patency - IVC: contrast mixing in IVC can appear similar to a hypodense filling defect - Abdominal aorta (Please refer to physical handbook page 528 for associated AAA image): - Abdominal aortic aneurysm: focal dilatation >3 cm in maximum transverse diameter - Ruptured AAA: retroperitoneal hemorrhage adjacent to aneurysm, blood extending into perirenal or pararenal spaces or psoas muscles. High attenuation crescent representing acute hematoma within mural thrombus or aneurysm wall suggests impending rupture - Visceral arteries (celiac, splenic, common hepatic, renal, SMA, IMA) - Iliac, pelvic, and femoral arteries and veins Lymph Nodes Throughout the abdomen and pelvis. Evaluate size (general guideline is <10mm short axis), morphology, enhancement. - Lower chest, upper abdomen (gastrohepatic ligament, celiac, portocaval, porta hepatis), retroperitoneum, mesentery, pelvis (inguinal, mesorectal, sidewall) Reproductive Organs Generally not well evaluated with CT, can be used as an adjunct to imaging with ultrasound or MRI Ovarian torsion: enlarged ovary, ovary shifted medially, twisted ovarian pedicle in the adnexa, adnexal fat stranding, underlying ovarian mass Pelvic inflammatory disease: tubular adnexal \"mass\", fallopian tube thickening, uterosacral ligament thickening, complex pelvic free fluid, pelvic fat stranding or haziness Abdominal Wall Hernias, hematomas, solid or cystic masses, skin/soft tissue infection Musculoskeletal Important to assess using bone windows - Fractures - Destructive osseous lesions - Degenerative changes Additional Resources for Abdomen and Pelvis CT Interpretation: https://radiopaedia.org/cases/how-to-read-a-ct-of-the-abdomen-and-pelvis?lang=us https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/rg.210129 Gastrointestinal Fluoroscopy Though plain film radiography and CT are crucial diagnostic tools, they are limited by their ability to only capture images at one point in time. Fluoroscopy allows for dynamic and functional imaging, which is often invaluable in evaluating gastrointestinal pathologies. Esophagram The exact technique varies by radiologist and the study indication; generally, the patient swallows several contrast boluses as images are obtained of the pharynx, esophagus, and proximal stomach Potentially much more sensitive than CT for the evaluation of perforation or fistula; however, in the emergent setting a CT chest/abdomen with an appropriately timed water-soluble oral contrast bolus may suffice Inpatient exams for indications other than perforation are nearly always appropriately deferred to the outpatient setting Upper GI Imaging is obtained of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to the ligament of Treitz; no imaging of the jejunum or ileum is obtained Often utilized for evaluation of esophageal hernias, post-operative complications, and gastric outlet obstruction Small Bowel Follow Through Essentially this is an Upper GI with additional serial images obtained to follow the contrast bolus until it reaches the cecum If obstruction is of concern, a version of this exam can be performed (Non-Fluoro SBFT) on the floor; after a period of gastric decompression via NGT the patient is instructed to drink 150-300 mL of water-soluble contrast while several serial abdominal radiographs are obtained until contrast reaches the cecum or the exam is aborted Contrast Enemas Often called barium enema, which is a misnomer since barium is rarely used Typically performed to evaluate suitability of distal bowel for ostomy reversal Dobhoff Tube Placement A common misconception is that there is direct visualization of the tube during the placement; in the fluoroscopy suite the radiologists are placing tubes in the exact same manner as on the floor The benefit is purely logistical since radiologists can take an immediate spot fluoro image to evaluate the tube position rather than needing to wait for an image to be obtained and interpreted There is no safety benefit and a request for fluoro guided placement should not be considered to be above routine priority Basic Chest X-ray Interpretation Always use a systematic approach. It doesn't matter what the approach is, just be consistent. Below is one example of a search pattern. Systematic Approach Assess quality: AP vs. PA; upright vs. supine; patient positioning; Is the whole chest included? Lines/tubes/drains/devices: What lines are present and are they in the expected locations? ET tube, central lines, NG tube/Dobhoff, Pacemaker, valve replacements Airway: Is the trachea midline? Mediastinum: Is it widened (masses, aortic injury, lymphadenopathy)? Cardiac: Is the heart enlarged (cardiothoracic ratio (maximal horizontal cardiac diameter/maximal horizontal thoracic diameter [inner edge ribs]) on PA CXR should be about 0.4-0.5) Pleural space: Is there a pneumothorax? Pleural effusion? Rest of image: Look for soft tissue changes\u2014foreign bodies, subcutaneous air. Look for bone abnormalities\u2014fractures, masses. Look for abdominal pathology\u2014air under the diaphragm, position of tubes Please refer to physical handbook page 530 for chest X-ray images with landmark identification table.

Available electronically on Eskind Biomedical Library. https://radiopaedia.org/articles/chest-radiograph-assessment-using-abcdefghi?lang=us Basic Non-Contrast Head CT Interpretation Imaging exam of choice for pts with acute CNS symptoms or traumatic head injury. High sensitivity for detection of neurosurgical emergencies (acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, territorial infarct, brain herniation, or hydrocephalus). Mnemonic for framework of quick Head CT review: Blood Can Be Very Bad Blood Appearance of blood varies by timing: - Acute blood is hyperdense (bright white) - Subacute (~1 week) blood becomes isodense to brain parenchyma - Chronic (>2 weeks) blood is hypodense (dark) Epidural Hemorrhage (extra-axial) Bleeding between dura mater and skull Does not cross skull sutures, expands inwards toward the brain parenchyma. Lentiform shape Often preceded by history of trauma, injury to middle meningeal artery (look for associated scalp injury, skull fracture) Please refer to physical handbook page 531 for associated epidural hemorrhage image. Subdural Hemorrhage (extra-axial) Bleeding between dura and arachnoid mater Does cross skull sutures Crescent shape Typically secondary to trauma with injury to bridging cortical veins Subacute subdural hemorrhage can be difficult to identify as it tends to resemble grey matter Please refer to physical handbook page 531 for associated subdural hemorrhage image. Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (extra-axial) Bleeding into subarachnoid space between arachnoid and pia mater Most apparent around the circle of Willis or in the Sylvian fissure CT sensitivity highly dependent on the amount of blood and time since hemorrhage Most commonly secondary to trauma or spontaneously from aneurysmal rupture Please refer to physical handbook page 532 for associated subarachnoid hemorrhage image. Intraventricular Hemorrhage (extra-axial) Blood within ventricular system Can be primary (blood in ventricles with minimal parenchymal blood) or more commonly secondary (secondary extension of parenchymal or subarachnoid bleed into ventricles) Tends to pool dependently, best seen in the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles Please refer to physical handbook page 532 for associated intraventricular hemorrhage image. Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage (intra-axial) Can be spontaneous (no underlying lesion \u2013 hypertensive or amyloid-related hemorrhage) or due to an underlying lesion (tumor, vascular malformation, or cerebral venous thrombosis) Traumatic intraparenchymal bleeding often is ipsilateral or directly contralateral to the site of injury (coup-contrecoup mechanism) Spontaneous bleeding related to uncontrolled hypertension classically occurs in the deep grey matter structures (like basal ganglia and thalamus) Please refer to physical handbook page 533 for associated intraparenchymal hemorrhage image. Cisterns Subarachnoid or basal cisterns = compartments within the subarachnoid space where CSF pools between arachnoid and pia mater. Contains vasculature and cranial nerves Assess for hemorrhage (subarachnoid), effacement, and asymmetry Multiple, with major cisterns including: Sylvian cisterns: between frontal and temporal lobes Suprasellar cistern: above the sella turcica, under the hypothalamus Quadrigeminal cistern: between the tectum, splenium of the corpus callosum and the superior cerebellum Prepontine cistern: anterior to the pons, posterior to the clivus Cisterna magna Brain Please refer to physical handbook page 533 for associated brain image. Gross evaluation of parenchymal structure, identification of major parenchymal abnormalities Symmetry of bilateral sulci and gyri, sulcal effacement Parenchymal attenuation: Acute blood, calcification, IV contrast = hyperdense Air, fat, ischemia, edema = hypodense Grey-white matter differentiation: compare to the contralateral side. Loss of grey-white matter differentiation is an early sign of ischemic insult Midline shift: evaluate the midline structures (falx cerebri, septum pellucidum) for mass effect Edema Cytotoxic edema: result of ischemia or infarction. Affects grey and white matter Vasogenic edema: Usually related to a lesion (tumor or abscess). Blood-brain barrier disrupted. Affects mainly white matter with preserved grey-white matter differentiation Herniation Shifts of cerebral tissue from normal location into adjacent space Secondary to a change in intracranial volume and increase in intracranial pressure (edema, tumor, hemorrhage) Masses Better assessed with intravenous contrast Look for associated hemorrhage, edema, calcification, mass effect Ventricles Intraventricular hemorrhage (described above) Be aware that dense choroid plexus calcifications may resemble acute intraventricular hemorrhage Asymmetry Hydrocephalus: important to determine if it is obstructive or communicating to identify the underlying cause Temporal horns tend to dilate first in the setting of hydrocephalus Ventricular effacement: thinning of ventricles; can be secondary to cerebral edema, space occupying lesion, hemorrhage Please refer to physical handbook page 534 for associated ventricle images. Bones Important to evaluate bony structures with dedicated bone windows Fractures of the calvarium and skull base may be subtle. Use signs of superficial soft tissue injury as a clue for underlying fractures Presence of gas (pneumocephalus), blood, and opacification of sinuses may also hint at underlying fracture Additional Resources for Head CT Interpretation: https://radiopaedia.org/articles/ct-head-an-approach?lang=us https://radiologyassistant.nl/neuroradiology https://litfl.com/ct-head-interpretation/ Consults for Radiology Procedures Radiology Procedures are performed by 3 separate consult services depending on the procedure requested.

We recommend that these get scheduled outpatient. - Place an outpatient consult to image guided procedures at time of discharge/through discharge tab in EPIC to facilitate outpt biopsies Drain Management Best to discuss directly with service that placed the drain (IR vs. CT/US vs. surgery) - Flush with 10 mL sterile saline q shift while inpt (flush into drain towards the pt and then place back to gravity or accordion suction bag) If drain output decreases, either: The collection (e.g. abscess) has been drained The drain is clogged, malfunctioning, or mispositioned Start with making sure there are no kinks in the drain, the 3 way is not clogged, and that the accordion drain is functioning Next, ensure the drain flushes appropriately. What this means is: you can flush the drain with 10 ml of saline and when you place back to gravity/accordion drainage bag you get back what you flushed in. There should be no leakage around the drain at the skin at baseline or during flushing If the drain is functioning, and there is still no output, obtain a CT w/ IV contrast to evaluate the collection and ongoing need for drainage If the collection remains, and drain is appropriately positioned within the drain, it is likely clogged/malfunctioning. First ensure proper suction/3-way direction. If this is not the issue, you can consider instilling tPA into the catheter for 2 hours Would avoid in the setting of therapeutic anticoagulation given increased risk of bleeding unless discussed with procedural service Epic order: Alteplase (TPA) injection/infusion options \u2192 percutaneous drainage \u2192 2mg or 4mg If this doesn't improve output in 48 hours, consider repositioning drain (VIR consult) Additional References Labs and Anticoagulation for CT/US and Vascular IR Procedures Based on 2019 SIR Consensus Guidelines.

Abbreviations: - SpA = seronegative spondyloarthropathy - RA = rheumatoid arthritis - SLE = systemic lupus erythematosus - SSc = systemic sclerosis - UCTD = undifferentiated connective tissue disease - MCTD = mixed connective tissue disease - IgG4-RD = IgG4-related disease - GPA = granulomatosis with polyangiitis - EGPA = eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis - MPA = microscopic polyangiitis - HSP = Henoch Sch\u00f6nlein purpura - Cryo = cryoglobulinemia - CTD = connective tissue disease - PMR = polymyalgia rheumatica - FMF = familial Mediterranean fever - EDS = Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Approach to Joint Pain Author: Tina Arkee Background MSK complaints account for >20% of all outpatient visits in the US The goal is to formulate a ddx based on good history taking and thorough physical exam that leads to accurate diagnosis and timely therapy while avoiding excessive diagnostic testing and unnecessary treatment History Articular (within the joint) vs. extra-articular (involving muscles, tendons, bursae, bones) - Articular: pain with passive and active ROM, swelling, crepitus, joint instability, joint deformity - Extra-articular: pain with active ROM only, may have focal tenderness near the joint, typically no crepitus, instability, or deformity Chronology - Acute: < 6 weeks - Chronic: >6 weeks Inflammatory vs. noninflammatory - Inflammatory: swelling, warmth, erythema, worse with rest, morning stiffness > 30 min - 1 hr - Non-inflammatory: worse with activity, morning stiffness < 30 min - 1 hr Localized (monoarticular) vs. diffuse (oligo/polyarticular) - Monoarticular: 1 joint - Oligoarticular: 2-4 joints - Polyarticular: >4 joints Symmetric vs asymmetric Size of joints involved (small vs. large) Presence/absence of signs & symptoms of systemic inflammation Physical Exam Visually inspect the affected joint. Inflamed joints may look red, swollen, or deformed. Palpate the joint for warmth, effusion, focal tenderness (inflammatory) or bony enlargement (non-inflammatory) Perform passive and active ROM exam. Articular joint pain is elicited by passive and active ROM and may also have crepitus. Extra-articular joint pain is only elicited by active ROM. Look for signs of systemic inflammation, including rashes, mucosal ulcers, hair and nail changes. For polyarticular complaints, the goal is to determine inflammatory vs noninflammatory Inflammatory: joint swelling, warmth, visible deformities. More common in MCP and wrist Non-inflammatory: bony enlargement, Heberden's nodes (DIP), Bouchard's nodes (PIP), CMC squaring, prominence of the medial tibial plateau, absence of joint effusions (except the knees with severe OA). More common in DIP and weight-bearing joints. Evaluation CBC w/diff, ESR, CRP Synovial fluid analysis (if joint effusion present and especially with a new acute monoarthritis; see \"Arthrocentesis Quick Look\" section) Disease-specific serologies, as indicated X-ray: may be normal in early disease; can be used to monitor disease progression Inflammatory arthritis: early changes include soft tissue swelling and periarticular demineralization \u2192 later changes include erosions, uniform joint space narrowing, and joint subluxation Non-inflammatory arthritis (i.e. osteoarthritis): non-uniform joint space narrowing, osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis, subchondral cysts Ultrasound: May demonstrate findings of inflammatory arthritis including synovial hypertrophy, tissue vascularity (via doppler) and effusion; structure localization may guide arthrocentesis MRI: more sensitive than xray and CT, but not necessarily more specific Please refer to physical handbook page 542 for a diagram of joint pain diagnostic algorithm. Arthrocentesis Quick Look Author: Tina Arkee Indications for arthrocentesis: Monoarthritis (acute or chronic) Suspicion for infection, crystal arthropathy, or hemarthrosis Trauma with joint effusion When diagnosis is unclear despite history and other workup Relative Contraindications to arthrocentesis Extensive cellulitis or psoriatic plaque around the site of interest (risk of introducing bacteria into a sterile space) Coagulopathy Bacteremia Concern for infection of a prosthetic joint \u2013 these should only be tapped by Ortho! What to order Synovial fluid exam (includes cell count and crystal exam). *Note: may see similar cell counts in gout and septic arthritis. The presence of crystals does not necessarily rule out septic arthritis. Body fluid gram stain and culture Who should tap?

Extra-articular: acute anterior uveitis, psoriasis, IBD Typically encompasses 4 of 5 features: age of onset <40 years, insidious onset, improvement with exercise, no improvement with rest, pain at night (improvement upon arising) Evaluation Labs: No specific laboratory tests for AS HLA-B27 is often present (90% of white patients; lower in other groups), though not necessary for diagnosis Elevated CRP and ESR in 50-70% of pts with active AS and less frequently elevated in pts with non-radiographic subtype Imaging X-ray and MRI: joint space narrowing and sclerosis secondary to erosive changes in SI joint, pelvis, and/or spine; bony ankylosis/fusion can eventually be seen in progressive disease MRI can reveal inflammatory changes (bone marrow edema); helpful in non-radiographic (X-ray negative) subtype Classification criteria is used for diagnostic purposes Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society Criteria (2011): \u22653mos back pain before 45yo and either sacroiliitis on imaging + \u22651 other axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) feature OR HLA-B27 positive + \u22652 SpA features SpA features: arthritis, dactylitis, enthesitis, psoriasis, IBD, uveitis, FHx, HLA-B27 Management Initial therapy: NSAIDs for symptomatic axial spondyloarthropathies. Occasionally NSAIDs alone improve symptoms and are the only medications required Refractory symptoms: 1st line TNF inhibitors followed by IL-17 inhibitors (second option, most effective in pts with concomitant psoriasis). JAK inhibitors also approved. Physical therapy: intensive rehabilitation and exercise improve mobility and symptoms Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) Author: Tina Arkee Background Chronic inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis (occurring in up to 20-30% of psoriasis patients) Incidence: onset usually around 30-50y; men and women equally affected. Psoriasis usually precedes the development of arthritis Etiology: multigenic autoimmune disease that involves inflammatory infiltrate (likely driven by CD8 T cells) to entheses, synovial tissue, and skin. Joint trauma may trigger arthritis flare (\"deep\" Koebner phenomenon) Classified under seronegative arthritis, though up to 15% of patients will have serologic positivity (RF most common) Presentation Variable joint pattern involvement (may evolve over time): DIP arthritis asymmetric oligoarthritis (large joint involvement in addition to small joints) symmetric polyarthritis (may look like RA) axial arthritis (involves the spine and SI joints) arthritis mutilans (severe destructive joint disease leading to osteolysis and shortening of digits) Periarticular manifestations: Enthesitis: inflammation of tendon and ligament insertion sites, including the Achilles tendon, patellar tendon, and spinous processes of vertebral bodies Tenosynovitis: flexor tendons of hands and posterior tibial tendons often involved Dactylitis: diffuse swelling of a single finger or toe (sausage digit). Acute dactylitis presents with a red, hot, tender, swollen digit, whereas chronically affected digits are often just swollen. Extra-articular manifestations: nail changes (pitting, ridging, onycholysis), psoriasis plaque, chronic bilateral uveitis, conjunctivitis Comorbidities: Decreased bone mineral density, psychiatric disease (depression, anxiety), hyperuricemia, increased risk of CVD/metabolic syndrome/DM/fatty liver Evaluation Laboratory data: CBC, BMP, uric acid, ESR, CRP; consider HIV testing Autoimmune testing to rule out other conditions: ANA (shouldn't have high titer positivity), RF (positive in 2-10%), anti-CCP HLA-B27: present in 25-30% patients; identifies patients at risk for axial disease or acute anterior uveitis but does not diagnose them Imaging X-rays often show evidence of both bone erosion and new bone formation, such as the \"pencil in cup\" deformity (often involves the DIP), osteolysis leading to digital shortening, bone spurs at entheses, periosteal reactions (new bone formation around eroded sites), and ankylosis (fusion of adjacent joints). MRI changes can be more sensitive in detecting articular and soft tissue inflammation and sacroiliitis; however, these do not always correlate with clinical symptoms CASPAR classification criteria for diagnosis are >90% sensitive and specific for PsA (\u22653 points = diagnostic) Current psoriasis (2), a personal history of psoriasis (1), or family history of psoriasis (1) Psoriatic nail findings observed on physical exam (1) Negative test for RF (1) Current dactylitis or a history of dactylitis documented by a rheumatologist (1) Xray evidence of juxta-articular new bone formation in the affected hand or foot (1) Management Non-pharmacologic strategies: PT/OT, exercise, weight loss, nutritionist referral for metabolic syndrome, dermatology referral for comanagement Treatment is dependent on pattern of involvement, skin disease, severity, and comorbidities Mild: NSAIDs (e.g. naproxen 375-500mg BID) Moderate or resistant to NSAIDs: conventional DMARDS (e.g. MTX 15-25mg q weekly or leflunomide 20mg QD) or occasionally apremilast (PDE4 inhibitor) if avoiding biologics Severe (many joints, erosive, functional limitation) or no response to above: biologic DMARD, usually TNF inhibitor (infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept); if no response, trial to another TNF inhibitor. If TNFi are contraindicated OR psoriasis is severe, try an anti-IL17a biologic (secukinumab, ixekizumab). Patients with concomitant IBD may benefit from anti-IL12/IL-23 agents (ustekizumab). Anti-IL17 biologics are contraindicated in patients w/IBD. Refractory to two TNFi/IL-12/IL-23: consider the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib Note: avoid oral glucocorticoids given risk of developing erythroderma or pustular psoriasis! Skin and joint disease often do not correlate \u2014 evaluate independently Rheumatoid Arthritis Author: Anika Morgado Background Chronic systemic inflammatory disorder of synovial joints, typically polyarticular, that results in proliferation of synovial tissue and consequent loss of articular cartilage and juxta-articular bone Incidence: most often onset around 30-60y; female:male ratio of ~3:1. Etiology: genetic (particularly specific HLA-DR4 and DR1 haplotypes) + environmental (e.g. smoking) triggers autoantibody formation (i.e. RF and anti-CCP) within the synovium, resulting in innate and adaptive immune cell infiltration May be classified as seropositive (RF or anti-CCP present) or seronegative; seropositive is typically more severe joint disease, increased risk of extra-articular manifestations, stronger heritability Presentation Usually insidious onset of polyarticular, often symmetric joint pain and swelling; often with morning stiffness (i.e. >30min) Classically affects MCPs, PIPs, wrists, ankles, MTPs, knees Classically spares DIPs and axial skeleton (except for C1-C2 in severe disease) Constitutional symptoms: fatigue, widespread pain, comorbid psychiatric disease (depression) Extra-articular manifestations (primarily in seropositive RA only) Osteopenia, rheumatoid nodules (usually on skin but can form anywhere including lungs), sicca symptoms, scleritis, ILD, constrictive pericarditis, rheumatoid vasculitis, anemia, neutropenia (associated splenomegaly) RA is an independent risk factor for CAD Evaluation Clinical diagnosis based on symptoms as above with physical exam concerning for active synovitis/inflammatory joint changes; supported by serologic and imaging findings MCP subluxation, ulnar deviation, Swan and Boutonnieres deformities are late findings of untreated RA 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria are less helpful (only 50% specific; nearly any inflammatory polyarthritis will meet criteria) Serologic workup: anti-CCP (95% specificity), RF (75-80% sensitivity and specificity), ESR/CRP (tends to correlate with disease activity), CBC (anemia or thrombocytosis); CMP, Hep B/C, TB screen for treatment planning RF is nonspecific; can be seen in any disease with chronic stimulation of humoral immune system (HBV, HC, Sjogren's, lymphoma, cryoglobulinemia) Overall poor sensitivity; up to 20% of patients are seronegative Imaging: Baseline plain films of hands/feet; early changes include soft tissue swelling and peri-articular osteopenia; late changes include marginal erosions and joint space narrowing Consider MRI and/or MSK ultrasound to detect early synovitis/erosions Management Goal of treatment: achieve early remission or low-disease activity to improve symptoms, prevent joint damage, and reduce long-term cardiovascular morbidity. Ideal response is 50% effective at 3 months and 90-100% effective at 6 months 1st line: MTX 15-25mg weekly (with folate); may use with NSAIDs and/or steroids temporarily to rapidly reduce disease activity until DMARDs take effect (~2-6 months) 2nd line: no clear guidelines, often dependent on patient-specific factors. Consider TNF inhibitors (usual preferred 2nd line agent), rituximab (particularly in seropositive disease), abatacept (particularly in the elderly), tocilizumab (especially if systemic symptoms), JAK inhibitors (if patient strongly prefers oral agent; avoid if history of DVT/PE or CAD) If resource-limited or biologics are contraindicated, consider HCQ, sulfasalazine, and/or leflunomide (often in combination) Crystalline Arthropathies Author: Thomas Horton Gout Presentation Red, hot, swollen joint (classically affects 1st metatarsal phalangeal joint [podagra]) May progress to involve ankles, knees, elbows, and small joints of hand if untreated Flares may also become polyarticular over time and include systemic symptoms like fever Tophi (firm, yellow deposits of monosodium urate in soft tissue) may develop over time in olecranon, Achilles tendon, ear helix Gout is diagnosed with combination of clinical presentation and arthrocentesis results Lifestyle factors: Protective: Low fat dairy, hydration, weight loss, smoking cessation Promoting: Meat, seafood, alcohol, high fructose corn syrup, medications that lead to hyperuricemia (e.g. thiazides) Evaluation Diagnosis: arthrocentesis remains gold standard but typically a clinical diagnosis. If arthrocentesis is unavailable or presentation is atypical, can use 2015 ACR/EULAR classification criteria: \u22651 episode of peripheral joint or bursa swelling, pain, or tenderness + scoring system based on uric acid level, clinical features (e.g. 1st MTP involvement, erythema over joint, tophus), imaging Synovial fluid analysis: See \"Arthrocentesis Quick Look\" section for more detail Cell count and differential: WBC 20,000-100,000, > 50% neutrophils Examination for crystals under polarizing light microscopy: (order \"Synovial Fluid Eval\" so the lab knows to look for crystals) Imaging: generally unnecessary but can be helpful (especially if no active flare or polyarticular flares) MSK ultrasound: \"Double contour sign\" (hyperechoic band = urate crystals deposits) Radiographs: Punched out erosions or lytic areas with overhanging edges Dual energy CT scan: crystal aggregates appear green. Not routinely necessary but may be helpful to identify extraarticular locations. Do not order without rheumatology consult. Management Acute Do not hold allopurinol during an acute flare if the patient is already taking chronically 1st line: NSAIDs (if not contraindicated): short course (2-5 days) at full anti-inflammatory dose (ibuprofen 800 mg TID, indomethacin 50 mg TID, naproxen 500 mg BID) with colchicine 1st line: colchicine (avoid if GFR <10 mL/min. Dose reduce by 50% if GFR <50 mL/min) Best if used within the first 36 hours of an attack. Much less effective if started later. Dosing: 1.2 mg then 0.6 mg one hour later, then 0.6 mg daily until clinical improvement Note drug interactions that may require dose adjustment of colchicine: Statins, diltiazem, fluconazole, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, clarithromycin, etc. 2nd line: steroids (use if NSAIDs and colchicine are contraindicated or ineffective) Ideally intra-articular if 1-2 joints affected and infection has been ruled out Oral prednisone 0.5mg/kg/day until clinical improvement, then taper over 7-14 days 3rd line: IL-1 inhibitors (anakinra 100mg QD x3 days or canakinumab) if flare refractory to 1st line treatment or other treatments contraindicated. Requires rheumatology consult. Chronic Urate Lowering Therapy (ULT) Indications: strong= >2 attacks/year, one or more subcutaneous tophi, radiologic changes. Conditional indication= CKD 3 or worse, urolithiasis, serum urate >9 Goal serum urate: <6.0 mg/dL, or <5.0 mg/dL in pts with tophi Prophylaxis: ULT can precipitate an acute gout flare and should always be started with low-dose NSAIDs, colchicine (0.6 mg) or prednisone (5 mg daily or QOD). This should be continued for at least 3 months after reaching urate goal with no tophi or 6 months if tophi present 1st line: allopurinol (xanthine oxidase inhibitor) Start at 100 mg daily (sometimes even 50mg daily in those with advanced CKD) and titrate monthly by 100mg to target uric acid <6 (most pts will need 400-800 mg daily; consider deferring uric acid recheck until at least reaching 300mg). Slow titration decreases risk of flare and DRESS syndrome. Genetic testing (HLA-B*5801) recommended prior to starting for pts of Asian and African descent given \u2191 incidence of allopurinol hypersensitivity if positive allele Allopurinol can be started during a flare if the flare is being treated. 2nd line: febuxostat (alternative xanthine oxidase inhibitor); consider for pts at risk for DRESS or SJS related to allopurinol. Black box warning for \u2191 cardiovascular risk; more expensive than allopurinol 3rd line: probenecid (uricosuric); consider in patients failing XOI. Avoid in renal disease or nephrolithiasis 4th line: pegloticase (uricase); for severe, refractory gout with tophi When to refer: consider Rheumatology consult for pts with refractory serum urate levels >6.0 despite 1st or 2nd line ULT Additional Pearls There is a microscope in the rheumatology clinic at VUMC (TVC 2). You can page the rheumatology fellow and they are happy to help you use it Uric acid level is often normal during acute gout flare Shifts in uric acid may be the trigger of the flare: diuresis, dietary changes, hospital stays Pseudogout \u2013 Calcium Pyrophosphate Dihydrate Crystal Deposition Disease (CPPD) Presentation More prevalent in the elderly populations Cannot distinguish acute episodes from gout based on clinical features alone (red, hot, swollen joint) Can mimic OA with multiple joints affected without inflammatory arthritis (\"pseudo OA\"), RA with acute flare of polyarthritis (\"pseudo RA\"), or septic arthritis Evaluation No formal diagnostic criteria; clinical diagnosis +/- crystals +/- imaging Synovial fluid analysis: See \"Arthrocentesis Quick Look\" section for more detail Cell count and differential: WBC 20,000 to 100,000, >50% neutrophils Rhomboid-shaped, positively birefringent. X-ray: chondrocalcinosis (thin calcified line present in fibrocartilage) in the joint space; specifically often seen in the meniscus of the knee joint or triangular fibrocartilage just distal to the ulna Management Acute: typically mirrors gout flare treatment; ranges from NSAIDs (1st line) to colchicine (2nd line) to steroids (3rd line). Can also use anakinra in acute cases with consult to rheumatology. Chronic: IL-1 inhibition (off-label) can be useful in chronic inflammatory CPPD. For those with frequent flares, consider daily colchicine prophylaxis Additional Information CPPD can be associated with other disorders: hyperparathyroidism, hemochromatosis, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, hypothyroidism, Wilson disease Consider further workup for these conditions, especially in a younger pt. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Author: Lale Ertuglu Background Multisystemic autoimmune disease characterized by loss of immune tolerance, resulting in autoantibody formation to nuclear material and immune complex deposition Incidence: typical onset at 16-35y but juvenile and late-onset forms exist Prevalence: More common in women (~9:1). Affects 1:1000 in the US; more common in Black, Hispanic, Asian, and indigenous populations Etiology: genetic predisposition (HLA-DR2/DR3 variants, as well as non-HLA genes including those involved in complement and cytokines) + environmental factors (estrogen, infection, UV light, viruses, medication, heavy metals) result in break in immune tolerance with auto-reactive antibodies and T-cells targeting antinuclear antigens, subsequently with abnormal cytokine inflammatory cascades and immune complex formation Presentation Constitutional: fatigue (most common complaint), fevers, myalgia, weight loss MSK: arthralgias and arthritis (usually polyarticular, symmetric, migratory and non-erosive) often involving MCPs/PIPs/knees/MTPs, Raynaud's. Mucocutaneous: malar rash, discoid skin lesions, photosensitivity, painless oral (usually palatal) ulcers, nasal ulcers, scarring alopecia from discoid lupus is specific (vs non-scarring diffuse alopecia which is common) Cardiac: pericarditis (~25% of pts will develop at some point in disease course), verrucous (Libman-Sacks) endocarditis, myocarditis, increased risk CAD Hematologic: anemia of chronic disease (most common), leukopenia, ITP, AIHA Renal: Lupus nephritis is the most common organ-threatening manifestation, can be refractory to therapy. Diagnosed and classified with renal biopsy. - Renal biopsy indicated if idiopathic AKI or progression of CKD, or if persistent proteinuria or hematuria - Class I and II are usually clinically silent. Class III and IV typically present as nephritic syndrome, class V mostly presents as nephrotic syndrome. Most patients present as an overlap (such as III + V or IV +V) Pulmonary: pleuritis (if chronic may be complicated by shrinking lung syndrome), pleural effusion, ILD, pHTN Neurologic: stroke, cerebritis, psychosis, mononeuritis multiplex Ophtho: keratoconjunctivitis sicca (2/2 Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome) GI: dysphagia due to esophageal dysmotility, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, elevation of LFTs (significant liver disease is rare) Evaluation Serologic workup: CBC, BMP, UA with sediment and Ur Pr:Cr ratio (screen for nephritis), ESR/CRP (nonspecific), ANA (sensitivity >98%) with reflex (including highly specific anti-dsDNA and anti-Smith), complement levels (C3 & C4 usually low in active disease) Additional workup: if history of DVT or recurrent pregnancy loss, consider APLS antiphospholipid antibody testing (lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin, anti-\u03b22 glycoprotein); if concern for myositis overlap, consider CK Can use 2019 ACR/EULAR classification criteria to guide diagnosis: (requires positive ANA \u22651:80 as entry criterion; then score \u226510 points across domains meets criteria) 2019 ACR/EULAR Classification Criteria Clinical Criteria Weight Laboratory Criteria Weight Constitutional Antiphospholipid antibodies Fever 2 Lupus AC, CL, \u03b22GP1 2 Hematologic Complement proteins Leukopenia 3 Low C3 OR C4 3 Thrombocytopenia 4 Low C3 AND C4 4 Autoimmune hemolysis 4 SLE-specific antibodies Neuropsychiatric Anti-dsDNA OR Anti-Smith 6 Delirium 2 Psychosis 3 Seizure 4 Mucocutaneous Non-scarring alopecia 2 Oral ulcers 2 Subacute cutaneous OR discoid lupus 4 Acute cutaneous lupus 6 Serosal Pleural or pericardial effusion 5 Acute pericarditis 6 Musculoskeletal Joint involvement (2+ joints) 6 Renal Proteinuria (>0.5g/24h) 4 Renal Bx Class II or V lupus nephritis 8 Renal Bx Class III or IV lupus nephritis 10 Management Treatment goal: control flares and prevent end-organ damage Acute flare: often will require steroids; aim for lowest dose for shortest possible period Mild disease: prednisone \u2264 10mg/daily Severe/organ-threatening: steroid pulses (e.g., methylprednisolone 500\u20131000 mg IV x 3 days) + biologic (e.g. MMF or cyclophosphamide in lupus nephritis) with subsequent steroid taper Maintenance therapy should be changed if regular flares occur Maintenance: 1st line: HCQ 200-400mg/day (5mg/kg) Requires retinal screening at baseline and annually after 5 years of therapy Not immunosuppressive Safe in pregnancy with improved pregnancy outcomes and reduced neonatal lupus 2nd line: highly dependent on organ involvement; consider MTX, azathioprine, MMF, belimumab, anifrolumab, rituximab Lupus nephritis: increasing emphasis on upfront combination therapies with mycophenolate mofetil combined with either belimumab or voclosporin Monitoring: usual biologic toxicity monitoring. Additionally, at least semiannual UA, UPCR, and creatinine to evaluate for lupus nephritis, even if asymptomatic. Trending rising dsDNA and low complements can predict flare. Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) Author: Eva Niklinska and Raeann Whitney Background Multisystem autoimmune disease characterized by immune dysregulation causing vascular dysfunction and fibrosis of skin and internal organs Distinguish from localized scleroderma (morphea or linear scleroderma) which is dermal fibrosis without internal organ involvement Categorized into 2 major subtypes: Limited cutaneous (lcSSc): skin thickening limited to the neck, face, or distal to elbows and knees; spares the trunk and proximal extremities. Raynaud's may develop years before other manifestations, which then slowly accumulate over 5-10 years. + anticentromere antibody Renal crisis is rare High risk for developing PAH Diffuse cutaneous: skin thickening extends proximal to the elbows/knees or trunk; rapid development of cutaneous and multiorgan involvement More associated with anti-Scl-70 ab Typically more abrupt onset and rapid progression compared to limited High risk for progressive ILD + RNA polymerase III Ab = high risk of renal crisis, higher risk for malignancy Incidence: onset typically 30-60y, more common in females (~4:1) Etiology: unknown trigger causes microvascular injury and activation of collagen \u2192 excess collagen deposition Presentation CREST: Calcinosis cutis, Raynaud phenomenon, Esophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly, Telangiectasia (CREST syndrome is no longer a discrete diagnosis but incorporated into lcSSc) Systemic: fatigue, weight loss Vascular: Raynaud's +/- digital tip ulcers, telangiectasias, nailfold capillaroscopy with dilated capillary loops Skin: Sclerodactyly, loss of facial wrinkles, decreased oral aperture, calcinosis cutis MSK: arthralgias, myalgias, flexion contractures GI: Esophageal or intestinal dysmotility, GERD, GAVE (watermelon stomach) Pulm: ILD (NSIP, UIP), pulmonary arterial hypertension Cardiac: pericardial effusions, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, conduction system disease Renal: renal crisis Evaluation 2013 ACR/EULAR Classification Criteria \u2192 weight-based symptom scoring Laboratory workup: ANA w/ reflex, Scl70, anticentromere, RNA pol III (separate order in Epic, increased risk of scleroderma renal disease) Imaging/Procedures: Baseline PFTs, lung HRCT, TTE, EKG, 6-minute walk test, EGD Skin biopsy: Not often used for dx, may be required to differentiate other rare disorders (eosinophilic fasciitis, linear scleroderma, scleromyxedema) 2013 ACR/EULAR Classification Criteria Items Sub-items Weight Skin thickening of fingers of both hands extending proximal to metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints 9 Skin thickening of fingers (only count the highest score) Puffy fingers 2 Whole finger, distal to MCP 4 Fingertip lesions (only count the highest score) Digital tip ulcers 2 Pitting scars 3 Telangiectasia 2 Abnormal nailfold capillaries 2 Pulmonary arterial hypertension and/or interstitial lung disease 2 Raynaud's phenomenon 3 Scleroderma-related antibodies (any of anti-centromere, anti-topoisomerase I [anti-ScL 70], anti-RNA polymerase III) 3 Pts with a total score of \u22659 are classified as having definite systemic sclerosis (sensitivity 91%, specificity 92%) Management Organ-Based Symptomatic Therapy Raynaud's: CCB (amlodipine, nifedipine), PDE5i, topical nitroglycerin GERD: PPI Renal: Monitor BP and Cr Scleroderma renal crisis: abrupt onset of HTN and renal dysfunction that typically presents early in disease course (can precede skin thickening), usually triggered by steroids Workup: AKI, proteinuria, MAHA, elevated renin Treatment: short-acting ACEi (captopril, enalapril); may require HD ILD: Periodic PFTs (isolated DLCO may suggest PAH); monitor for respiratory symptoms, pulmonology referral Cardiac/PAH: annual TTE, cardiology referral Systemic Immunosuppression (if progressive skin thickening or organ involvement) MTX, MMF, tocilizumab, cyclophosphamide, if refractory rituximab, IVIG Nintedanib may be used in combination with immunosuppression in ILD Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies (IIM) Author: Tina Arkee Background Heterogenous group of disorders that classically present with painless proximal muscle weakness; some subtypes may present with additional systemic features such as antisynthetase syndromes (e.g. ILD, rash, inflammatory arthritis, mechanics' hands, Raynaud phenomenon) Subtypes (non-exhaustive): dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis (PM), antisynthetase syndrome, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), inclusion body myositis (IBM) Differential diagnosis: statin-induced myopathy, metabolic (hypothyroid, electrolyte), viral/infectious myositis, diabetic myonecrosis Important point: PMR= painful, preserved strength vs inflammatory myopathy = painless weakness Consider screening patients for underlying malignancy, particularly in DM and PM \u2013 up to 15-30% of cases are associated with malignancy (specific antibody present can further risk stratify) Presentation Acute vs. Chronic Acute or subacute: DM, PM, IMNM Gradual and progressive: IBM Distribution of weakness Proximal and symmetric: DM, PM, IMNM Distal and asymmetric: IBM (often involves weakness of finger flexor muscles) Systemic signs or symptoms: fever, rash, dyspnea, dysphagia, arthritis DM: Gottron's papules, heliotrope rash, shawl sign, mechanics hands Anti-synthetase syndrome: cough/dyspnea, arthritis, Raynaud's or mechanics hands, and sometimes fever IBM: can present with dysphagia; advanced cases may present with muscle atrophy Consider patient's medications including exposure to statins and steroids Evaluation Diagnosis: clinical but can use 2017 EULAR/ACR Classification Criteria for Adult and Juvenile Myositis; weighted point system including age of onset, distribution, skin involvement, elevated muscle enzymes, EMG, muscle biopsy, myositis-specific antibodies Labs: CMP, TSH, CK level, LDH and aldolase + extended myositis panel (screens commonly associated antibodies including anti-Jo1, anti-Mi2, etc.) MDA5 Ab is associated with rapidly progressing ILD, which may present with AHRF TIF1 and NXP2 Abs are associated with underlying malignancy EMG: useful for ruling out neuromuscular etiologies MRI extremity/affected muscle group: can help guide biopsies and evaluate edema on T2 and STIR (high signal intensity on these sequences may reflect active inflammation) and fatty replacement (reflects muscle damage) on T1. Skin biopsy in dermatomyositis: \"interface dermatitis,\" notably the same findings as skin biopsy of lupus rashes Muscle biopsy: gold standard for diagnosis but not always necessary (especially in dermatomyositis) Do not do biopsy in same muscle as EMG done Dermatomyositis: perifascicular and perivascular inflammatory infiltrate (CD4+ T cells and dendritic cells) Polymyositis: endomysial inflammatory infiltrate (CD8 T cells) IMNM: variable stage necrotic fibers, scant inflammatory infiltrate IBM: endomysial infiltrate, intracellular vacuoles, protein aggregates Management If suspected, consult Rheumatology! 1st line: DM/PM: high-dose steroids (1mg/kg/day prednisone) for 4-6 weeks PLUS steroid-sparing agent (MTX, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil) IMNM: high dose steroids for 4-6 weeks PLUS IVIG and rituximab IBM: poor response to immunotherapy; focus on supportive care and aggressive PT/OT/SLP 2nd line: IVIG, rituximab, abatacept, or tofacitinib Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome Author: Meridith Balbach Background Systemic autoimmune disorder primarily targeting exocrine glands causing sicca symptoms; may also involve musculoskeletal, pulmonary, renal, neurologic, and hematologic features May be primary or secondary (occurring alongside another autoimmune disease such as RA or SLE) Incidence: presents most often around age 40-60y; female-to-male ratio ~9:1 Etiology: genetic predisposition (e.g. increased risk with specific HLA-DQA_DQB_ haplotypes) + environmental factors triggers aberrant autoantibody production and lymphocytic infiltration of glands (predominantly CD4+ T cells; also B cells), resulting in glandular dysfunction Presentation Classic sicca: dry eyes (gritty, burning, or foreign body sensation) and dry mouth (difficulty chewing/swallowing dry foods, frequent water intake, dental caries) Extra-glandular features: MSK: arthralgias, arthritis, myalgias Dermatologic: eyelid dermatitis, Raynaud's, cutaneous vasculitis Hematologic: cytopenias, hyper- and hypogammaglobulinemia, monoclonal gammopathy, cryoglobulinemia; non-Hodgkin lymphoma, particularly MALT lymphoma (most feared complication; higher risk if persistent parotid enlargement or hypocomplementemia) Pulmonary: ILD, xerotrachea, bronchiectasis Gastrointestinal: dysphagia, chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain May also include neurologic, renal, cardiovascular (but typically <5%) Evaluation Serologic workup: ANA with reflex (typically + Anti-Ro/SSA or anti-La/SSB), RF (often positive, even in the absence of RA), immunoglobulins, ESR (often elevated) and CRP (usually normal or mildly elevated) Anti-Ro/SSA is most sensitive and specific but is not diagnostic Additional workup: Schirmer test, slit-lamp exam, salivary flow rate Gold standard: labial salivary gland biopsy Clinical diagnosis but 2016 ACR/EULAR classification criteria can help guide in unclear cases (score \u22654 confirms classification): + anti-Ro/SSA (3) Focal lymphocytic sialadenitis (3) Ocular staining score \u22655 (1) Schirmer's test \u22645 mm/5 min (1) Unstimulated salivary flow \u22640.1 mL/min (1) Management Treatment is currently targeted to organ involvement (though several biologics are being studied). Immunosuppression is not used for dryness symptoms. Xerophthalmia: preservative-free artificial tears, cyclosporine eye drops; punctal plugs if refractory Xerostomia: frequent sips, sugar-free lozenges or gum, saliva substitutes + good dental hygiene; muscarinic agonists (e.g. pilocarpine) if persistent MSK: hydroxychloroquine Organ-threatening disease: steroids +/- steroid-sparing agent (MMF, azathioprine, rituximab) IgG4-Related Disease (IgG4-RD) Author: Meridith Balbach Background Multi-organ, immune-mediated fibrotic disease characterized by diffuse or focal organ enlargement with tumor-like mass formation secondary to massive infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells with storiform fibrosis Incidence: usually >60y; more often affects men Prevalence: unclear but quite rare; pancreatic involvement most common Etiology: poorly understood; genetic predisposition + environmental factors lead to CD4+ T cell and B cell activation that stimulate fibroblasts and promote tissue remodeling through unclear mechanisms Presentation Usually subacute related to gradual progressive enlargement of affected organ(s) or found incidentally. Fevers and acute illness are not expected features. Presentation highly variable, dependent on affected organ: Pancreas (\"type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis\"): painless obstructive jaundice, mild abdominal discomfort, weight loss; rarely acute pancreatitis Biliary duct: obstructive jaundice Glands (lacrimal, salivary; \"Mikulicz disease\") Retroperitoneum: periaortic inflammation, ureter compression Also: central nervous system, thyroid gland, lungs, liver, gastrointestinal tracts, kidneys, prostate, mesentery, lymph nodes, etc. 2+ organ involvement most often (60-90%) Evaluation Serologic: IgG4 (fairly sensitive: >130mg/dL in 70-80%; at higher levels, very specific: if >280mg/dL, 99%), elevated ESR and CRP, +ANA (nonspecific but seen in 50%), elevated RF (nonspecific but seen in 20%), low C3/4 (particularly in renal and pancreas involvement) Gold standard: biopsy of affected organ with abundant infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells and lymphocytes, storiform fibrosis, and obliterative phlebitis ACR/EULAR classification criteria can help guide diagnosis (meets criteria if entry criteria met, no exclusion criteria present, total points \u226520): Entry: clinical or radiologic involvement of a classically affected organ OR pathologic evidence of inflammatory process with lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate Exclusion: clinical (fever, absence of objective response to steroids), serologic (numerous including presence of several other autoantibodies, peripheral eosinophilia, etc.), radiologic (findings suspicious for malignancy, rapid interval progression, splenomegaly), pathologic (findings suggestive of alternative pathology), known alternative diagnosis (multicentric Castleman's disease, etc.) Inclusion criteria: consistent features on histopathology (0-13), IgG4 immunostaining (0-16), serum IgG4 (0-11), glandular involvement (0-14), chest (0-10), pancreas and biliary tree involvement (0-19), renal involvement (0-10), retroperitoneal involvement (0-8) Management Indications for treatment: (1) demonstrated or anticipated organ damage, (2) high disease activity, (3) symptomatic relief. Consider watchful waiting in those with mild, asymptomatic disease or stable remission Induction: oral prednisolone starting at 0.6 mg/kg/day, x2\u20134 weeks, followed by gradual taper over 2-3 months to maintenance dose Organ-specific management (e.g. biliary stenting) Monitoring: highly individualized based on number and severity organ involvement, initial IgG4 level, initial response to steroids (can use IgG4-RD Responder Index scores to help guide) but combination of symptoms, IgG4 levels, imaging (CT/MRI/PET) Maintenance: oral prednisolone 2.5\u20135 mg/day; depending on medical comorbidities, may continue indefinitely versus attempt taper within 3 years Relapse: Re-induction with steroids and/or steroid-sparing agents (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, rituximab) ANCA-Associated Vasculitis Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) Author: Hannah Angle Background Necrotizing vasculitis of small vessels characterized by granulomatous inflammation Presentation Constitutional symptoms: fevers, fatigue, weight loss Vasculitis: pulmonary hemorrhage, mononeuritis multiplex, glomerulonephritis (hematuria, proteinuria) Granulomatous inflammation: sinus and/or middle ear involvement, rhinorrhea, epistaxis, pulmonary nodule, cavitary pulmonary lesions (dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis) Evaluation ANCA + (typically PR3-cANCA) ESR/CRP, ANA, anti-GBM, C3/C4, cryoglobulins, HBV/HCV, HIV UA with microscopy (hematuria, proteinuria, RBC casts, dysmorphic RBCs) CT chest if pulmonary symptoms Biopsy: necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis, pauci-immune glomerulonephritis Clinical Pearl: If you suspect renal disease (elevated Cr, hematuria), ask the renal or rheum fellow to help spin the urine to evaluate for RBC casting or dysmorphic cells. Quick way to confirm active GN, since renal biopsy takes time to arrange. Management Mild-moderate disease: MTX + prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/day followed by steroid taper Severe disease: rituximab (first line) + prednisone 1mg/kg/day (60-80mg max) If failed response to rituximab, cyclophosphamide can be used. For pts with RPGN, pulmonary hemorrhage, mononeuritis multiplex or optic neuritis: IV methylprednisone 7-15mg/kg/d (1000mg max) x3d for induction therapy DVT ppx (high risk for DVT/PE) Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA) Author: Hannah Angle Presentation Similar to GPA, but without granulomatous involvement (no upper respiratory tract involvement or pulmonary nodules); classically only involves lungs and kidneys Evaluation ANCA + (typically MPO-pANCA) ESR/CRP, ANA, anti-GBM, C3/C4, cryoglobulins, HBV/HCV, HIV UA with microscopy (hematuria, proteinuria, RBC casts, dysmorphic RBCs) CT chest if pulmonary symptoms Biopsy: necrotizing vasculitis (no granulomas), pauci-immune glomerulonephritis Management Same as GPA, see above Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA) Author: Hannah Angle Presentation Similar to GPA/MPA. Predominant symptoms include atopic symptoms (asthma, rhinosinusitis) and peripheral eosinophilia. Vasculitis manifestations are more rare, and when they occur, mononeuritis multiplex is the most common, unlike pulmonary hemorrhage or renal involvement in GPA/MPA. Cardiac involvement (accounts for 50% deaths from EGPA): coronary arteritis, myocarditis, heart failure, arrhythmias Skin involvement (>50%): tender subcutaneous nodules Evaluation ANCA + (typically MPO-pANCA, positive in about 50-60% of pts) Peripheral eosinophilia IgE, ANA, RF, C3/C4 Biopsy: necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis, eosinophilic infiltrates with fibrinoid necrosis, pauci-immune glomerulonephritis Management Mild-moderate disease: prednisone 0.5-1 mg/kg/day for 6-12 weeks followed by steroid taper Severe: cyclophosphamide + prednisone 0.5-1 mg/kg/day for 6-12 weeks followed by steroid taper For pts with life-threatening multiorgan involvement (cardiac, pulmonary, renal, neurologic): IV methylprednisone 1000mg daily x 3 days for induction therapy ACR guidelines now also recommend mepolizumab for non-severe disease (instead of rituximab or cyclophosphamide) plus steroids as initial induction therapy. Severe disease still requires rituximab or cyclophosphamide) DVT ppx (high risk for DVT/PE) Cryoglobulinemic Vasculitis Author: Meridith Balbach Background Cryoglobulins = Circulating immunoglobulins precipitate in the cold Classification of cryoglobulins: Type I: monoclonal immunoglobulin (IgM or IgG); associated with lymphoproliferative disorders (Waldenstr\u00f6m's, MM, CLL, B cell lymphomas) Type II: mixed (monoclonal IgM with +RF* polyclonal IgG); associated with chronic infection (particularly chronic Hepatitis C) Type III: polyclonal IgM + IgG with +RF; associated with autoimmune disease *RF activity by definition is the reactivity of an IgM component with the Fc portion of an IgG Deposition of cryoprecipitate may result in small vessel vasculitis Presentation Systemic features (fatigue, arthralgia, myalgia) + organ-specific Skin (most common): palpable purpura (usually in lower extremities/colder areas), livedo reticularis Renal: proteinuria, hematuria, HTN (MPGN) Neurologic: peripheral neuropathy (mononeuritis multiplex) Evaluation General: Serum cryoglobulins (fastidious collection, see above), C3/C4 (hypocomplementemia), RF (positive in types II/III), ANA w/ reflex (evaluate for underlying autoimmune etiology), hepatitis B and C serologies, SPEP with immunofixation End-organ specific: urinalysis +/- renal biopsy (if findings c/f MPGN), skin biopsy (leukocytoclastic vasculitis) Management Treat underlying etiology, if possible For moderate-severe disease or end-organ disease, consider corticosteroids, rituximab, cyclophosphamide Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN) Author: Hannah Angle Background Necrotizing vasculitis of medium-sized muscular arteries, leading to segmental transmural inflammation with fibrinoid necrosis, aneurysm formation, thrombosis, and downstream ischemia Incidence: onset usually in middle age/older adults (peaks in the 5th decade) Often idiopathic but frequently associated with Hepatitis B (historically up to 30% of cases), Hepatitis C, hairy cell leukemia, monogenic forms Presentation Systemic + vessel-specific symptoms Constitutional symptoms: fatigue, weakness, fevers, arthralgias, myalgias, rash, weight loss Vasa nervorum: Asymmetric polyneuropathy with motor and sensory deficits (foot drop, radial/ulnar neuropathy) Cutaneous: livedo reticularis, palpable purpura, ulcers, tender erythematous nodules, bullae, vesicles Renal: HTN Mesenteric: abdominal pain and melena Coronary: ischemic cardiomyopathy Testicular: orchitis Evaluation Elevated ESR/CRP, CBC (normocytic anemia and leukocytosis), Hepatitis B panel, Hep C with reflex, negative ANCA Arteriography: MRI, CT, or angiogram with classic \"string of pearls\" appearance Biopsy: segmental transmural inflammation of muscular arteries, fibrinoid necrosis of arterial wall (no granulomas, presence suggests another process) Management Mild disease (e.g. isolated cutaneous disease): prednisone 1mg/kg daily (max 60-80mg) for 4 weeks followed by steroid taper Moderate disease: cyclophosphamide + prednisone 1mg/kg daily (max 60-80mg) for 4 weeks followed by steroid taper Severe/life-threatening disease (renal failure, significant proteinuria, GI/cardiac/neurologic involvement): cyclophosphamide + 500-1000mg IV methylprednisolone daily for 3 days, followed by prednisone 1mg/kg daily (max 60mg) for 4 weeks followed by steroid taper Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) Author: Lauren Waskowicz Background Most common large-vessel vasculitis characterized by granulomatous inflammation of medium and large arteries, particularly the cranial branches of the carotid artery Incidence: most commonly >50 years old, slight F > M predominance Closely linked to PMR (up to 50% of patients with GCA have PMR, and ~15\u201330% of PMR patients develop GCA) T-cell dysregulation, IL-6-mediated inflammation, and macrophage-driven vascular remodeling cause intimal hyperplasia and vessel occlusion Presentation Systemic + vessel-specific symptoms Systemic: Fatigue, low-grade fever, malaise, weight loss Extracranial arteries: temporal unilateral headache, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, visual disturbance (blurred vision, amaurosis fugax, or sudden irreversible loss), diplopia Large-vessel arteries: arm claudication, bruits, aortic aneurysm or dissection. 15-20% of patients will have large vessel involvement without extracranial arterial involvement. Evaluation ESR/CRP (almost always elevated), CK, TSH Evaluate for any temporal artery abnormalities (tenderness to palpation, presence of nodules) Ophthalmology evaluation if any concern for ocular involvement Temporal artery biopsy by vascular surgery (typical in the US) OR temporal artery ultrasound (evaluate for presence of Halo sign) If high suspicion for GCA with negative biopsy or ultrasound, perform further imaging to evaluate for large vessel involvement (CT/CTA or MRI/MRA of aorta and/or branches) Management 1st line treatment \u2192 glucocorticoids are cornerstone of treatment Start glucocorticoids as soon as GCA is suspected, do not delay while awaiting biopsy; early treatment can prevent irreversible vision loss! No vision symptoms: prednisone 1mg/kg daily (max 60 mg) for 2-4 weeks followed by taper over months Vision symptoms: IV methylprednisolone 500\u20131000 mg/day \u00d7 3 days \u2192 then prednisone 1 mg/kg/day (max 60 mg) with taper Consider tocilizumab as adjunctive in those with steroid-refractory disease or those at higher risk for glucocorticoid-related side effects (since most pts with GCA are elderly, this applies to most pts) Bisphosphonates will be commonly indicated for prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. A bone density test should be obtained at baseline to assess if other anabolic therapies should be used in higher risk pts. Takayasu's Arteritis Author: Hannah Angle Background Chronic large-vessel vasculitis that primarily affects the aorta and its major branches, often leading to vascular stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm formation Incidence: onset usually <30 years old; 80-90% cases in females; strong predilection for individuals of Asian, Middle Eastern, and Latin American descent Etiology: T-cell and pro-inflammatory cytokines drive granulomatous inflammation of vessel wall Presentation Biphasic course: initial systemic inflammatory phase followed by vascular occlusive phase Subacute constitutional symptoms: fevers, arthralgias, myalgias, rash, weight loss Cardiovascular: angina from coronary arteritis, HTN (renal a. involvement), discrepant BP between arms (arterial stenosis), diminished or absent pulses (\"pulseless disease\"), carotidynia (tenderness of the carotid a.), arterial bruits, limb claudication, carotid/vertebral arteritis (vertigo, headache, syncope, strokes), mesenteric ischemia Evaluation ESR/CRP: often elevated, though can be normal during active disease Arteriography: MRA or CTA of head/neck, chest, and abdomen/pelvis Management New arterial stenosis or aorta/carotid artery involvement: 1mg/kg prednisone daily (max 60-80mg) for 2-4 weeks followed by steroid taper Organ threatening disease (coronary artery involvement, critical stenosis of carotid/vertebral arteries): 500-1000mg IV methylprednisolone daily for 1-3 days, then 1mg/kg prednisone daily for 2-4 weeks followed by steroid taper Beh\u00e7et's Disease Author: Meridith Balbach Background Chronic relapsing variable vessel (i.e. affects small, medium, large) vasculitis preferentially affecting veins with consequent wide-ranging mucocutaneous, ocular, neurologic, vascular, GI, and joint manifestations. Incidence: usually onset age 20-40y (rare >40y); equally affects men and women (but men more likely to have severe disease); coined the \"Silk Road disease\" due to increased frequency in the Middle East and Central Asia Etiology: genetic predisposition (strongest risk conferred by HLA-B*51 allele) + environmental factors results in (via unclear mechanisms) prominent neutrophil activation and MHC class I regulation defect \u2192 dysregulated innate (autoinflammatory) and adaptive (autoimmune) immunity Differential diagnosis (consider very broad DDx given many nonspecific features): Sweet syndrome, IBD, HSV, reactive arthritis, erythema multiforme, bullous disease Presentation Initial relapsing-remitting course with symptoms dependent on vessels involved Mucosa: painful, shallow oral ulcers (seen in >90%); scarring painful genital ulcers Skin: erythema nodosum-like nodules, papulopustular lesions, acne, pyoderma gangrenosum, pathergy reaction Ocular: uveitis (anterior, posterior, or pan-uveitis) and retinal vasculitis Arthritis: non-erosive, oligoarticular; often migratory Vascular: pulmonary artery aneurysm, DVT/PE, dural venous thrombosis, Budd-Chiari syndrome, retinal vasculitis CNS: brainstem or hemispheric lesions, aseptic meningitis, meningoencephalitis Gastrointestinal: ileocecal ulceration, abdominal pain, bleeding Subsequent undulating course: most patients manifest symptoms within 5 years of diagnosis, then improve slowly over time Evaluation Diagnosis is clinical; no diagnostic criteria 2014 IBCD International Criteria for Beh\u00e7et's Disease (classification criteria) can help guide (score \u22654 supports diagnosis): recurrent oral ulcers (2), genital ulcers (2), ocular lesions (2), skin lesions (1), vascular lesions (1), positive pathergy test (1) Management Highly individualized based on specific organ involvement and severity Mucocutaneous and/or arthritis: colchicine +/- topical steroids (1st line), apremilast, azathioprine, biologics (adalimumab, etanercept, etc.) Thrombotic: anticoagulation is controversial. Very important to exclude pulmonary artery aneurysms prior to initiating anticoagulation due to risk of bleeding. Moderate/severe disease (uveitis, major organ involvement, vascular, CNS): systemic steroids, azathioprine, cyclosporine; if refractory, consider biologics (TNFi and IL-1/IL-6 inhibitors) or cyclophosphamide Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR) Author: Tina Arkee Background PMR is a disorder of inflammatory pain and stiffness predominantly affecting shoulders and pelvic girdle (hips, sacrum, and coccyx) Incidence: typically >50 years, peak ages 70-80; more common in women (2:1) PMR is often seen in patients with GCA; occurs in up to 50% of GCA, while 15-30% of PMR patients develop GCA. Either condition may present initially, or may occur concomitantly Etiology: poorly understood but likely genetic predisposition (HLA DR4 allele, Caucasian background) and environmental factors (including infections) contribute to IL-6-mediated inflammatory response Presentation Acute or subacute onset of: bilateral, symmetric pain and stiffness of shoulders (in almost all cases), neck, and/or pelvic girdle that is worse in the morning and with inactivity +/- Difficulty with ADLs such as brushing their hair or teeth, lifting their arms to put clothing on, and rising from a seated position +/- Non-specific constitutional symptoms (fatigue, low-grade fever, weight loss) Physical exam: normal muscle strength. Objective muscle weakness should raise suspicion for another disease process. Screen for GCA red flag symptoms (headache, jaw claudication, visual changes, scalp tenderness) Evaluation Diagnosis: clinical diagnosis; can use ACR/EULAR 2012 classification criteria for patients \u226550 with new shoulder pain and elevated ESR/CRP (\u22654 if not using ultrasound; \u22655 if using ultrasound): morning stiffness lasting >45 min (2 points), hip pain or limited range of motion (1 point), negative RF and CCP titers (2 points), presence of pain in other joints (1 point), shoulder/hip ultrasound findings of inflammation (1 point) Labs: elevated ESR and CRP (almost always); consider TSH, CK, RF, anti-CCP to rule out mimics Imaging: MSK ultrasound may demonstrate bursitis, tenosynovitis, or non-PMR etiologies; similarly, MRI may confirm inflammation or demonstrate structural pathology Management 1st line: steroids, initially 12.5-25mg prednisone daily \u2192 assess response with expected improvement within 2-4 weeks. Lack of improvement strongly suggests an alternative diagnosis unless the patient has GCA. Taper: decrease slowly to the minimum effective dose (often 5mg/day for up to 1-2 years). CRP/ESR can help provide additional insight into disease remission/guide taper Refractory disease or high risk of steroid side effect: consider steroid-sparing agent (MTX, tocilizumab, sarilumab) Adult-Onset Still's Disease (AOSD) Author: Meridith Balbach Background Rare autoinflammatory syndrome characterized by systemic inflammation, spiking fevers, arthralgia/arthritis, and a salmon-colored rash Autoinflammatory diseases involve dysregulation of innate immune system (rather than dysregulation of the adaptive immune system, as in autoimmune disease) Includes both inherited (e.g. monogenic syndromes like Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), and TNF receptor\u2013associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS)) and acquired syndromes (e.g. AOSD and VEXAS) Incidence: generally sporadic (no clear genetic predisposition) at 16-35y but can occur at any age. Slight female predominance (51-60%). Rare (~0.16\u20130.4 cases per 100,000 persons annually) AOSD is the adult counterpart to systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis Presentation Classic triad: quotidian fevers (often late afternoon/evening), arthralgias/arthritis (often polyarticular and migratory), evanescent salmon-colored rash (maculopapular, often non-pruritic) Additional features: sore throat, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, serositis, elevated LFTs, hyperferritinemia Evaluation Diagnosis of exclusion: must rule out infection, malignancy, other inflammatory etiologies Serologic workup: elevated ESR/CRP, very high ferritin, CBC (mild leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, anemia), elevated LFTs, ANA and RF (should be negative) Imaging workup: consider to identify serositis or lymphadenopathy (nonspecific) 2023 ACR/EULAR classification criteria may help with diagnosis (requires \u22655 points total, including \u22652 clinical criteria; sensitivity: ~85% and specificity: ~99%) Clinical criteria: fever \u226539\u00b0C for \u22653 days (2), arthralgia or arthritis (2), evanescent rash (2), pharyngitis (1), lymphadenopathy and/or hepatosplenomegaly (1), serositis (pleuritis or pericarditis) (1) Laboratory criteria: neutrophils \u226580% (1), ferritin >1000 ng/mL (1), negative ANA and RF (1) Management Treatment is based on severity: Mild/moderate: NSAIDs and/or steroids Moderate/severe or steroid-refractory: steroids (prednisone 0.5\u20131 mg/kg/day) + MTX Severe systemic or refractory: steroids + IL-1 or IL-6 inhibitor Monitor for progression to secondary macrophage activation syndrome (progressive cytopenias, hyperferritinemia, coagulopathy, liver dysfunction, multiorgan failure) Sarcoidosis Author: Lale Ertuglu Background Multisystem disorder defined by forming noncaseating granulomas in different tissues Presentation Constitutional symptoms: fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, fevers, arthralgias, myalgias Pulmonary symptoms (most common): dyspnea, cough, and chest pain Extrapulmonary manifestations Cutaneous: Highly variable, but present in 25% of patients Papules, macules, or plaques commonly involving neck, upper back, extremities Lupus pernio: indurated, violaceous bumps on nose, lips, cheeks, ears Erythema nodosum Neuro Affects 5-10% of patients; involving any part of CNS or PNS CN palsies, hypothalamic/pituitary dysfunction, seizures, myelopathy or radiculopathy, hydrocephalus, aseptic meningitis CV: may affect pericardium, myocardium, and/or endocardium Valvular disorders Arrhythmias (most common CV manifestation) Cardiomyopathy Liver/Spleen: transaminitis, cirrhosis, anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia Ocular: Uveitis, secondary glaucoma, retinal vasculitis, keratoconjunctivitis L\u00f6fgren Syndrome: acute presentation with fever, bilateral hilar adenopathy, erythema nodosum or ankle arthralgia Incidental finding in chest imaging: >90% of patients have pulmonary or thoracic lymphadenopathy on presentation and ~50% of patients present with only incidental radiological findings Evaluation Combination of clinical features, radiographic manifestations, exclusion of other similarly presenting diseases, and noncaseating granulomas on pathology CXR: hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy \u00b1 pulmonary infiltrates. CXR stages are defined as below (stages do not represent disease activity) Stage 1: bilateral hilar adenopathy only Stage 2: bilateral hilar adenopathy + pulmonary infiltrates Stage 3: pulmonary infiltrates without hilar adenopathy Stage 4: pulmonary fibrosis that mainly involves upper lung zones High-resolution chest CT: lymphadenopathy (bilateral and symmetric), perilymphatic micro or macronodules, fibrotic changes (reticular opacities, traction bronchiectasis, volume loss, cysts) PFTs: may show restrictive disease (decreased TLC & VC) and diffusion impairment (reduced DLCO). Occasionally obstructive with endobronchial disease. Labs: CBC w/ diff, CMP, UA, quant-gold for TB or tuberculin skin test, HIV. Depending on endemic fungi, serologic testing for histoplasmosis or coccidiomycosis can also be included. ECG: should be obtained since AV block is the most common finding of cardiac sarcoidosis. Biopsy Important to rule out mimics. The differential for \"noncaseating granulomas\" is extensive, including lymphoma and fungal infections Not required for patients with asymptomatic bilateral hilar adenopathy or pathognomonic presentations including L\u00f6fgren syndrome and some cases of lupus pernio Management Most do not require therapy: monitor symptoms, CXR, PFTs at 3-6 month intervals Indications for treatment: highly symptomatic, progressive disease or severe disease at presentation Mainstay of treatment is oral steroids Dosing usually 0.3-0.6 mg/kg daily for 4-6 weeks If only symptom is cough, could consider inhaled glucocorticoids If unresponsive or unable to tolerate steroids may require alternative agents (MTX, AZA, TNFi) Fibromyalgia Author: Tina Arkee Background Heterogenous chronic pain syndrome characterized by widespread, constant pain and fatigue Incidence: 2-3% of adults in the United States, and up to 5% of adults worldwide. Similar prevalence in men and women but discordant diagnosis (account for more than 80% of diagnosed cases). Most often onset at 30-50y, but can occur at any age Etiology: poorly understood but likely multifactorial in the setting of hypersensitization to pain, physiologic and emotional/psychological stressors, sleep disturbances, and genetic and environmental factors Presentation Commonly presents with widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbances lasting at least 3 months and NOT explained by another medical condition Patients may report concomitant brain fog, depression/anxiety, or GI symptoms Physical exam is most notable for tenderness to palpation of multiple sites, hyperalgesia (greater pain than expected), and allodynia (pain to nonpainful stimuli) Evaluation Rule out other medical conditions with a thorough history, exam, and labs and imaging as indicated (with the caveat that patients can have fibromyalgia and comorbid conditions) Workup: consider TSH, CK, CRP/ESR, vitamin D, CBC, CMP; additional workup based on presentation In unclear cases, can use the 2016 ACR fibromyalgia diagnostic criteria to assist: (1) generalized pain in at least 4 of 5 body regions (2) that is present for at least 3 months and (3) not attributed to another medical condition, AND (4): WPI of 7+ and SSS of 5+ OR WPI of 4-6 and SSS of 9+ (see below) Monitor symptom evolution with pain using patient-reported outcome scales: Widespread Pain Index (WPI, 0-19): areas on the body where a patient experienced pain in the past week Symptom Severity Score (SSS, 0-12): severity of symptoms including fatigue, unrefreshing sleep, cognition, headache, abdominal pain or cramps, and depression Management 1st line: Multidisciplinary approach with initial focus on non-pharmacologic measures such as low-impact exercise (can be very beneficial), optimizing sleep hygiene, ruling out sleep disorders, mindfulness and meditation, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and treating any mood disorders 2nd line: for refractory cases, start medications based on the predominant symptom (pain, mood, or sleep) FDA-approved: Pregabalin (pain and sleep), duloxetine (pain and depression/anxiety), and milnacipran (pain and mood) Off-label: TCAs (low-dose amitriptyline or nortriptyline for sleep and/or pain), gabapentin, SSRIs, muscle relaxers, low-dose naltrexone AVOID steroids or opioids","title":"Rheumatology"},{"location":"Rheumatology/#rheumatology","text":"Editor: Meridith Balbach MD Reviewed by: Tyler Reese, MD","title":"Rheumatology"},{"location":"Rheumatology/#overview-classification-of-rheumatic-disease","text":"Author: Meridith Balbach Classification approach to select rheumatologic diseases.

Neuss, MD, PhD, under the guidance of Jennifer K. Green, MD, MPH in 2019. We would like to thank the following individuals for their contributions to the 7th Edition of the Housestaff Handbook: The many VUMC residents (past and present) who have meticulously authored each section of this handbook. The VUMC faculty who carefully reviewed each topic for its accuracy. Chase Webber, DO, who was a sounding board for our new ideas throughout the year as the Handbook's faculty advisor. C. Beau Hilton, MD for his work in updating and improving the online version of this handbook. Hilary Tindle MD, PhD and the Vanderbilt Center for Tobacco, Addiction and Lifestyle (VITAL) for supporting the publication of the physical copy of the book. John McPherson, MD, Jane Freedman MD, Kristy Braden and Maria Kasel, for their unwavering support. Rationale for the Housestaff Handbook The aim of this handbook is to provide specific, systems-based guidance on practice at VUMC and the VA. We hope to provide readers with direct and actionable guidance, consolidating the combined wisdom of generations of residents and faculty experts. The Handbook represents a coordinated effort to disseminate details of our practice in a standardized, peer-reviewed format. The guidance provided by the handbook makes legible evidence-based practice as well as the oral tradition of a resident guiding an intern, or an attending a resident. We hope that this handbook will inspire confidence and learning, whether the reader is an intern on July 1 or a senior resident who wishes to refresh their memory of a topic. Disclaimers The handbook is not a substitute for clinical judgment and is intended as an educational guide. Content reflects current national guidelines, as well as practice at VUMC and the Nashville VA. The handbook is not intended to replace more comprehensive references or guides.

Bruccoleri, MD and Saralyn R. Williams, MD Management of Specific Overdoses Author: Lauren Chan, MD There are 5 main classes of drugs/toxins that induce bradycardia and hypotension (ABCDO): - A lpha-2 agonist - B eta-blockers - C alcium channel blockers - D igoxin and cardiac glycosides - O rganophosphates (Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) Alpha-2 Agonists Background Examples: clonidine, dexmedetomidine, guanfacine, methyldopa, tizanidine Mechanism: centrally acting inhibition of norepinephrine release \u2192 \u2193 noradrenergic activity Evaluation Physical Exam: early/transient HTN, attenuated sympathetic response (decreased HR, BP), opioid toxidrome (pinpoint pupils, CNS depression, respiratory depression) Laboratory abnormalities: None associated with overdose EKG: sinus bradycardia Management IVF and high dose naloxone 10mg IVP followed by 5 mg/hr if there is no response Naloxone may reverse the CNS and respiratory depression as well as hypotension Vasopressors such as norepinephrine/epinephrine are used if naloxone does not work Beta Blockers (BB's) Background Mechanism: competitively block catecholamines at beta-adrenergic receptors \u2192 \u2193 inotropy and chronotropy; impaired gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis Lipophilic BB's (propranolol, metoprolol): cross the blood brain barrier \u2192 CNS depression Membrane stabilizing BB's (propranolol): QRS prolongation, dysrhythmias, and seizures Sotalol: potassium channel blocking properties \u2192 QTc prolongation and dysrhythmias Evaluation Physical Exam: CNS depression, seizures, myocardial depression, respiratory depression Laboratory abnormalities: Hypoglycemia or normoglycemia ECG: Sinus bradycardia, AV block (low grade), QRS widening (propranolol), QTc prolongation (sotalol) Management IVF, calcium gluconate 3 g Glucagon 10 mg over 10 min and infusion 3-5 mg/hr (need infusion since half-life is 6 min) Vomiting can occur if administered too fast Epinephrine or norepinephrine should be first line vasopressors Atropine 0.5-1mg q3-5min Intralipid infusion if refractory HoTN or patient codes from a lipophilic BB (e.g. propranolol) Intralipid (Lipid Emulsion) 20% infusions: 1.5 cc/kg bolus followed by 0.25 cc/kg/min for 60 minutes (for 70 kg adult: 1 liter over 1 hour) for refractory hypotension or if patient codes), max dose is 10 ml/kg or 1200 ml whichever is greater however, there is limited guidance on a max dose - if using lipid emulsion therapy, please call Toxicology or Poison Control immediately BB induced arrhythmias: sodium bicarbonate (adjunct QRS widening) and Mg for QTc prolongation induced Torsades de pointes Significant sotalol toxicity: hemodialysis Calcium Channel Blockers (CCB's) Background Two categories: Dihydropyridines (DHP) and non-dihydropyridines (Non-DHP) DHP (amlodipine, nifedipine): peripheral > central channels, selectivity is lost in overdose Non-DHP (diltiazem, verapamil): primarily cardiac calcium channels Mechanism: - DHP: arterial vasodilation \u2192 reflex tachycardia - Non-DHP: peripheral vasodilation, decreased inotropy, bradycardia; calcium mediated insulin inhibition in the pancreas \u2192 hyperglycemia Evaluation Physical Exam: Markedly preserved mental status until patient is about to code Labs: hyperglycemia (elevated serum glucose concentrations are associated with severe overdose and sequelae) EKG: bradyarrhythmia, high-degree heart block (3rd degree) Management IVF, vasopressors if needed Bradycardia: atropine 0.5-1mg q3-5min (not effective for second- or third-degree block), calcium gluconate 3g, and glucagon 10 mg over 10 min followed by infusion 3-5 mg/h Hypotension + Bradycardia High dose insulin/euglycemic therapy (HIE) - High-dose insulin 0.5-1 unit/kg bolus followed by 0.5-1 unit/kg/hour infusion titrated to up to 10 units/kg/hour. Call Toxicology immediately if exceeding 3 units/kg/hour - Give with dextrose. Titrate insulin like a pressor. Blood pressure may take up to 20 minutes to change - May increase contractility through increasing the cardiac utilization of glucose. Not likely to help with vasodilation or bradycardia Vasopressors (norepinephrine or epinephrine): may consider phenylephrine for DHP induced vasoplegic shock with tachycardia Intralipid should be used in code/refractory hypotensive situations for lipophilic CCB's (verapamil, amlodipine, diltiazem) - 20% infusions: 1.5 cc/kg bolus followed by 0.25 cc/kg/min for 60 minutes (for 70 kg adult: 1 liter over 1 hour) for refractory hypotension or if patient codes), max dose is 10 ml/kg or 1200 ml whichever is greater however, there is limited guidance on a max dose - if using lipid emulsion therapy, please call Toxicology or Poison Control immediately Methylene blue for refractory distributive shock can be considered, but consult Toxicology prior to using Digoxin and Cardiac Glycosides Background Examples: Digoxin, yellow oleander, lanatoside C, foxglove, lily of the valley, bufo toads Mechanism: blockade of Na/K ATPase \u2192 increased intracellular calcium \u2192 increased contractility and may delay after depolarizations/shorten repolarization of the atria and ventricles \u2192 trigger arrhythmias; increased vagal tone Evaluation Physical Exam: lethargy, nausea, vomiting, reported yellow halos in visual fields (chronic) Labs: hyperkalemia (marker of acute toxicity but not the cause; correlates with mortality) EKG: any abnormality (though Afib RVR is unlikely, more likely to have a regular pulse due to 3rd degree block in the setting of Afib), biventricular tachycardia is classic but rarely seen Management Digoxin Fab Fragments Number of vials = [(serum level times the weight of the patient)/100] rounded up. Empiric treatment 10 vials. In acute on chronic toxicity or chronic toxicity, please contact the Poison Center or Medical Toxicology for guidance as less vials may be recommended to try to avoid adverse events from worsening heart failure or atrial fibrillation Unclear dosing for natural toxins (often empirically 10 vials for an adult) Indications: hemodynamic instability, significant unstable arrhythmia, end organ damage secondary to hypoperfusion (renal failure), or potassium \u22655.0 mEq/L It can also be indicated for patients with high post distribution digoxin levels even if they are asymptomatic. However, please contact Poison Control/Toxicology for guidance. Atropine 0.5-1mg q3-5min: severe symptomatic bradycardia when digoxin fab fragments are not available Given the sensitivity of the myocardium with digoxin, pacers can trigger significant dysrhythmias and only recommended if no access to digoxin fab fragments or fab fragment failure Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors Background Examples: Organophosphates (e.g. insecticides), carbamates, physostigmine, rivastigmine, donepezil Mechanism: Inhibition of the breakdown of acetylcholine \u2192 \u2191 acetylcholine stimulation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors Evaluation Physical Exam Muscarinic (DUMBBELS): Diarrhea/Diaphoresis, Urination, Miosis, Bronchorrhea/Bronchospasm, Bradycardia, Miosis, Emesis, Lacrimation, Salivation Nicotinic: fasciculations, muscle weakness, and/or muscle paralysis Intermediate syndrome: neurologic syndrome after resolution of cholinergic excess, decreased DTR, proximal muscle weakness, respiratory insufficiency, neck flexion weakness, CN abnormalities Laboratory abnormalities: Standard lab tests are not helpful EKG: sinus bradycardia, QTc prolongation Management Atropine: 1-2 mg (mild-moderate symptoms) vs 3-5mg (severe) IV repeated every 2-20 minutes or 1mg followed by doubling doses every 5 minutes until bronchorrhea is no longer present followed by an infusion 10-20% of the loading dose per hour (max 2 mg/hour) Pralidoxime: 30mg/kg (max 2g) loading dose followed by 8-10 mg/kg/hr (max 650mg/hr); WHO dosing is 2000 mg bolus followed by 500 mg/hr infusion. Consult Poison Control/Medical Toxicology for acetylcholinesterase inhibitor use. Seizures: Benzodiazepines Secretions: Titrate atropine to dry secretions (can require large amounts i.e. 50 mg) Bronchorrhea: Atropine as above Alcohol Background One standard drink = 12oz regular beer = 5oz wine = 1.5oz 80% distilled spirit Absorption primarily in duodenum/small intestine (80%) with 80-90% of absorption in <60 min in ideal conditions (i.e. empty stomach) Mechanism: Metabolism via alcohol dehydrogenase. Withdrawal due to CNS overactivity from decreased inhibitory tone (GABA) and unregulated excess excitation (glutamate binding to NMDA, dopamine) Evaluation Intoxication: slurred speech, disinhibition, incoordination, unsteady gait, memory impairment, nystagmus, stupor, coma, hypotension, tachycardia Wernicke encephalopathy (WE): encephalopathy, oculomotor dysfunction, gait ataxia, HA, n/v, hallucinations (12-24 hr after last drink), seizures (12-48 hr), DT (72-96 hr) Labs: EtOH, Peth, UDS, hypoglycemia, hyperlactatemia, hypoK, hypoMg, hypoCa, hypophos Management Intoxication: supportive care Withdrawal: thiamine, folate, multivitamin, IV fluid for intravascular depletion Thiamine Administer before glucose containing fluids - WE prevention: 100mg IV QD x3d - WE treatment (high risk): 500mg IV TID x3d followed by 250mg QD x3d, then 100mg QD Psychomotor Agitation Benzodiazepines (long-acting preferred) including diazepam, lorazepam, and chlordiazepoxide.

Drug-Induced QTc Prolongation Authors: Mohamed Salih, MD and Matthew Kern, MD Background QT is measured from the start of the Q-wave to the end of the T-wave (use the lead with the longest measurement) The time of ventricular depolarization + repolarization Prolongation is defined as QT > 440ms in males or >460ms in females QTc is the corrected estimate of QT assuming a rate of 60 bpm since QT decreases with tachycardia and increases with bradycardia QTcF (Fridericia) + QTcB (Bazett) are commonly included on ECG report (other formulas are available on MDCalc). QTcB often overestimates QT but is most accurate for bradycardia; QTcF is more accurate for tachycardia. \"B for brady, F for fast\" . Ventricular pacing and/or bundle branch block artificially prolongs QT One quick correction is QT - (QRS - 120), then plug in the result to the correction formula Can also use Mayo Clinic QTc Calculator to correct in cases of wide QRS or Afib (simply google this) QTc > 500 ms increases risk of Torsades de pointes (TdP), a life-threatening wide complex VT (see \"Wide Complex Tachycardias\" in the Cardiology section for evaluation and management of TdP) Two Main Causes of Prolonged QT Congenital/Hereditary (long QT syndromes/channelopathies) Acquired (Drug induced, anorexia, bradycardia, MI/BBB, hypothermia, hypothyroidism, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, increased ICP) Think of ABCDE for Common Medication Offenders A: Anti\"A\"rrythmics (class IA (procainamide, disopyramide) and class III (amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide)) Less clinical concern with amiodarone since its multiple mechanisms reduce risk of TdP despite QT prolongation B: Anti\"B\"iotics: (azoles, macrolides, quinolones) C: Anti\"C\"ychotics: 1st gen>2nd gen (chlorpromazine, haloperidol, risperidone) D: Anti \"D\"epressants: SSRIs, TCAs E: Anti\"E\"metics: Ondansetron, prochlorperazine, droperidol Other high risk medications: methadone, Arsenic (chemo), quinines (antimalarials), hydroxychloroquine Crediblemeds.org is a great resource to look up specific meds. It also shows risk of QT prolongation vs risk of inducing TdP (not always equal) Special note on ondansetron (Zofran): Risk IV > PO/ODT. Risk is greater if using IV dose > 16mg, other concomitant QT prolonging meds, concomitant congenital and/or acquired QT prolongation condition. Consider ECG if patient has these risk factors or if re-dosing within 2 hours. Presentation Most commonly asymptomatic Possible palpitations, seizure, syncope, SCD Evaluation Check recent EKG If patient is at high risk e.g. receiving antibiotics \u00b1 antiemetics while inpatient with QT >500, can monitor with EKG q 2-3 days Include the most recent QTc in your handoff for crossover resident Management If Stable Stop the offending medication (see ABCDE's above) if possible. Many meds have non-QT prolonging alternatives, e.g. scopolamine patch/alcohol wipe sniff for Zofran, doxycycline for azithromycin. Aggressive electrolyte repletion (K and Mg especially) Serial EKG monitoring \u00b1 monitor on telemetry If Progression to TdP Address ABCs ACLS, defibrillation if pulseless Empiric IV magnesium STAT page cardiology for overdrive pacing and likely transfer to CCU FYI: Most episodes of TdP self-terminate, but patients are likely to have multiple episodes. Up to 25% of TdP cases convert to VF. Brown Recluse Bites (Loxoscelism) Authors: Ashley Zeoli and Matthew Kern Background Only a handful of spiders are truly harmful to humans The brown recluse (a member of the Loxosceles genus) is widespread in the South, West, and Midwest US They are often found in homes (attics, basements, cupboards) and outdoors (rock piles and under tree bark) Their numbers increase in association with humans (i.e. synanthropic) Appearance/Identification Three pairs of eyes, a monochromatic abdomen and legs, very fine hairs on legs Using the \"violin\" pattern on its body is a poor way to identify this spider, as other harmless spiders can have similar markings Loxoscelism is the medical manifestation of the brown recluse spider bite Venom contains insecticidal toxins, metalloproteases, and phospholipases Presentation Bites are most common on the upper arm, thorax, or inner thigh Local Signs Usually painless, but can cause burning sensation with two small cutaneous puncture marks with surrounding erythema Usually appears as a red plaque or papule with central pallor, sometimes with vesiculation Usually self-resolves in 1 week Skin necrosis (10-20% of cases): Lesion can progress to necrosis overall several days An eschar will form that eventually ulcerates Usually will heal over several weeks to months Systemic Signs (rare, but more common in children) The degree of systemic effects does not correlate with the appearance of the bite Symptoms develop over several days, and include nausea, vomiting, fever, rhabdomyolysis, malaise, acute hemolytic anemia, significant swelling from head/neck bites that can compromise the airway, DIC and renal failure. Myocarditis is a rare adverse effect that may occur. Evaluation Presumptive diagnosis is based clinical presentation of the bite/wound DDx includes vasculitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, cellulitis, or other arthropod bites Definitive diagnosis is based upon observing a spider bite in combination identification by an entomologist Patients with local symptoms do not need any further workup Patient with any systemic symptoms require lab evaluation for more serious disease: CBC, UA to eval for \"blood\" without RBCs, CMP, CK If anemia: Type and Screen, peripheral smear, reticulocyte count, LDH, haptoglobin, coags to evaluate for hemolysis or DIC Please refer to physical handbook page 578 for flowchart on Brown Reclude Spider/Loxoscelism management. Management Local Signs Wound care (soap/water, elevation) Pain management Tetanus vaccine/prophylaxis if indicated Antibiotics only if signs of concurrent cellulitis Skin Necrosis Symptomatic and supportive care Surgical intervention can worsen cosmetic outcomes and is rarely indicated in the acute care setting. Skin grafting is occasionally needed for a very large ulcerative wound that is not healing. Infection is rare. Furthermore, the ulcerative base of the wounds often have a yellow stringy material that is not pus or infection. Please call Toxicology with any questions regarding brown recluse bites Systemic Signs Targeted at treatment of symptoms that develop (Consult toxicology) - Hemolytic anemia: generally, transfuse to keep hgb > 9-10. However, the rapidity of hemolysis is more important than the hgb for determining when to transfuse but almost always the threshold is higher than other forms of anemia. - Rhabdomyolysis: LR for UOP >200-300cc/hr - If patient develops chest pain: obtain EKG and check a troponin; if either is abnormal please obtain echo and call Toxicology as heart effects (i.e. myocarditis) is something we have been seeing at VUMC - DIC: supportive care Toxidrome Overview Author: Quinton Taylor Toxidrome Agent Symptoms Antidote Cholinergic Insecticides (e.g. organophosphates), physostigmine, neostigmine, pyridostigmine, pilocarpine, nerve agents (e.g. Sarin) Muscarinic: Defecation, Urination, Miosis, Bradycardia, Bronchosecretions, Emesis, Lacrimation, Salivation, Sweating (DUMBBELSS) Nicotinic: Mydriasis, Tachycardia, Weakness, Hypertension, Fasciculations (MTWtHF) Atropine (with pralidoxime if organophosphate poisoning) Anticholinergic Antihistamines, antipsychotics, antidepressants (TCAs), antiparkinsons, atropine, scopolamine Hyperthermia, dry skin, mydriasis, delirium, hallucinations, tachycardia, urinary retention, seizures (\"Hot as a hare, red as a beet, dry as a bone, blind as a bat, mad as a hatter\") Supportive care, consider physostigmine with toxicology Sympathomimetic Cocaine, amphetamines, bath salts, synthetic cannabinoids, sedative/hypnotic withdrawal, pseudoephedrine, caffeine Hyperthermia, mydriasis, diaphoresis, tachycardia, arrhythmias, hypertension, seizures None, supportive care; benzodiazepines as needed* Opioid Morphine, heroin, hydromorphone, fentanyl Miosis, hypoventilation, somnolence, comatose, bradycardia, hypotension Naloxone Sedative-hypnotic Benzos, barbiturates, alcohol, zolpidem CNS depression, confusion, stupor, coma None, supportive care only Hallucinogenic Phencyclidine, LSD, MDMA \"Ecstasy\" Hallucinations, depersonalization, agitation, mydriasis (usually), tachycardia, hypertension, nystagmus None, supportive care only Serotonin syndrome SSRIs, SNRIs, MOAIs Hyperreflexia, myoclonus, diaphoresis, flushing, diarrhea, hyperthermia, tachycardia, confusion, agitation, coma Supportive care; benzodiazepines as needed*; contact toxicology prior to using cyproheptadine *for treatment of seizures, tachycardia, hypertension, agitation, and hyperthermia General Workup ABCs, evaluate vital signs, mental status, pupil size, skin temperature and moisture Pulse ox, continuous cardiac monitoring, EKG, blood glucose Beta blocker (hypo or normoglycemia) and CCB (hyperglycemia) toxicity UDS, acetaminophen/salicylate level, ethanol levels UA, BMP, LFT, blood gas General Management Decontamination for topical exposures Antidotes if known ingestions/fits appropriate toxidrome Supportive care Discuss with Toxicology for possible ways to enhance elimination of the toxin (e.g. diuresis, alkalinization, dialysis, etc.)","title":"Toxicology"},{"location":"Toxicology/#toxicology","text":"Editor: Alice Kennedy, MD Faculty Editors: Rebecca E.
