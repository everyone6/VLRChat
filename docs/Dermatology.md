| Corticosteroid Potencies: |  |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Low Potency | Medium Potency | High Potency | Very High Potency |
| Desonide 0.05% (cream, lotion, ointment) | Triamcinolone (Kenalog) 0.1% (ointment, cream) | Betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% (ointment, cream, lotion) | Clobetasol 0.05% (cream, ointment, lotion, gel, foam) |

Corticosteroids: General Principles 

- Main side effects ➔ skin atrophy  
- Face and intertriginous areas ➔ low potency steroids ONLY   
- High potency steroids should be limited to 3 weeks of use 

*  Optimal absorption if applied after bathing (hydration promotes steroid penetration)   
- **Ointments** \- most potent due to occlusive effect, good for thick, hyperkeratotic lesions and areas of smooth, NON-hairy skin. Avoid hairy and intertriginous areas (can cause skin maceration and folliculitis)   
- **Creams** \- more cosmetically appealing and well tolerated. Less potent than ointments   
- **Lotions** \- Useful in hairy and intertriginous areas. Less potent than creams
