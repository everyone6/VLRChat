## Allergy

**Author: Lindsey Creech**

### Anaphylaxis

Sudden onset of signs and symptoms, usually in more than one body system, within minutes to a few hours of exposure to a trigger

**Most common s/s** are cutaneous (eg, sudden onset of generalized urticaria, angioedema, flushing, pruritus) [Note: 10 to 20% of patients have no skin findings]

**Danger signs** – Rapid progression of symptoms, respiratory distress (eg, stridor, wheezing, dyspnea, increased work of breathing, persistent cough, cyanosis), vomiting, abdominal pain, hypotension, dysrhythmia, chest pain, collapse

#### Treatment
- ABCs with removal of inciting event (stop inciting medication)
- IM epinephrine (0.3mg) autoinjector into the mid-outer aspect of the thigh may be repeated at 5- to 15-minute intervals if there is no response or an inadequate response or even sooner if clinically indicated
- Placement in supine position with BLE elevated, unless CI (airway swelling/vomiting)
- Supplemental oxygen
- Volume resuscitation with IV fluids with 2 large bore IVs
- Labs: tryptase

### Outpatient management

#### Seasonal allergies

**Symptoms:** runny nose, itchy/watery eyes, congestion, raised wheals (hives), eczematous rash

**Treatment:**
- Daily PO antihistamine (loratadine, fexofenadine, cetirizine) or daily nasal antihistamine (Astelin)
- Daily nasal fluticasone (Flonase) or Triamcinolone (Nasacort) one spray each nostril daily (increase up to BID)
- Antihistamine Eye Drops (Panatol) for conjunctivitis

**Refractory to medical therapy:** Referral to Allergy and Immunology for allergen immunotherapy

#### Food allergy

Combinations of the following symptoms: pruritus; urticaria; flushing; swelling of the lips, face, or throat; nausea; vomiting; cramping; diarrhea; wheezing; lightheadedness; syncope; or hypotension

**Treatment:** Patients should avoid the suspected food until further evaluation by an allergist. Prescribe Epinephrine autoinjector PRN (educate patient on use).

**Education:** If the patient experiences prompt, complete, and durable response to one dose of epinephrine and has access to additional epinephrine autoinjectors, the patient does not have to present to the ER. Situations that would warrant EMS activation include severe anaphylaxis, symptoms that do not resolve promptly, completely or nearly completely, or symptoms that return or worsen.

#### Drug allergy

**High risk reaction:** Severe anaphylactic symptoms within 1-6 hours of medication within the last 5 years, SJS, TEN, Serum sickness, Mouth/eye ulcerations

**Low risk reaction:** Greater than 5 years since last reaction, Urticaria only, GI symptoms only, Remote childhood reaction with limited details, FH of drug allergy, Known tolerance of drug since original reaction

**Treatment:**

**High risk allergy:** Strict avoidance of drug medications
- See penicillin allergy PDF: https://www.vumc.org/stewardship-help-desk-protocols/sites/vumc.org.stewardship-help-desk-protocols/files/public/Allergy-Antibiotic-028.pdf

**Low risk allergy:** Referral to drug allergy clinic for desensitization to antibiotics

**Why de-escalate?** "A recorded penicillin allergy was associated with a 14% increased risk of death. When allergy tested, 95% of adults with a recorded penicillin allergy are not allergic" (1)

## Anxiety/Depression

**Author: Lauren Waskowicz**

### Background

**Anxiety disorders:** spectrum of disorders characterized by excessive fear, anticipatory anxiety of future threat, or avoidance behaviors
- Includes generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobias, substance-induced anxiety disorder

**Mood disorders:**
- Include major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BPD), seasonal affective disorder, dysthymia

### Presentation

**MDD:** 2+ weeks of ≥ 5/9 SIGECAPS (sleep, interest, guilt, energy, concentration, appetite, psychomotor, suicide), or PHQ-2 screen >2 / PHQ-9 score > 4

**GAD:** 6+ months of anxiety and associated restlessness, fatigue, impaired concentration, sleep disturbances (use GAD-7 tool to assess)

### Evaluation

- Screen for personal and family history of substance use disorders (often comorbid with mood disorders)
- Screen for family members with MDD/GAD, and if positive, which SSRIs have worked (genetic component of responsiveness)
- Screen for suicidal ideation ("Have you ever had thoughts about wanting to be dead? Not wanting to wake up?")
  - If "yes," assess for active/passive ("in the past week, have you had any actual thoughts of killing yourself?"), plan/intent ("do you have a plan to kill yourself and do you have intent to act on them?")
  - Ask about prior psychiatric hospitalizations
  - Ask about firearms in the house
- Screen for periods of mania ("have you ever felt like you have needed <3-4 hours a night of sleep?") as this is a contraindication for SSRIs (below)
- PHQ-9 > 4 abnormal, >9 consider therapy +/- pharmacotherapy

### Management

No psychotherapy offered through VUMC. Counsel to call insurance customer service and ask for in-network counselors accepting new pts. Can also recommend psychology today website (https://www.psychologytoday.com/us) for assistance in finding therapy based on insurance coverage (.PSYCHTODAY)
- EPIC dot phrase for Nashville therapists (who have accepted OHO pts in the past): .CTLPSY-CHRESOURCES and .LRWPSYCHCOMMUNITY

**Persons in crisis:** for pts expressing active suicidal ideation with intent, can refer to:
- Centerstone (TN crisis line): (800) 681-7444
- Mental Health Cooperative (emergency line): (615) 726-0125

**Safety planning via removal of firearms from home**

## Asthma

**Author: Faria Khimani**

### Definition

Chronic inflammatory bronchial hyperresponsiveness, with episodic exacerbations and reversible airflow obstruction

**Prevalence:** 5-10% US population

### Risk Factors

Family history of asthma, history of allergies, atopic dermatitis, low SES

### Presentation

History of cough, recurrent wheezing, recurrent difficulty breathing, recurrent chest tightness

Symptoms occur or worsen at night or with exercise, viral infection, exposure to allergens and irritants, changes in weather, hard laughing or crying, stress, or other factors

### Diagnostics

**First line is spirometry.** (do NOT need full PFTs)

Asthma diagnosis most likely with evidence of obstructive disease AND excessive variability in lung function as measured by:
- FEV1 reduction w/ FEV1/FVC reduced compared to lower limit of normal (>0.75-0.80 in adults)
- Positive bronchodilator responsiveness: Increase in FEV1 >12% and >200L

Must rule out other common differentials: Panic attacks, upper airway obstruction or infection, foreign body, COPD, ILD, vocal cord dysfunction, CHF, ACE-i induced cough, OSA

CBC may show eosinophilia

If concerned for allergic asthma or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, consider measuring total serum IgE levels

### Classify Severity and Assess for Symptom Control with the RULE OF 2s

- Does the pt have symptoms or require rescue inhaler >2 times per week?
- Does the pt endorse nighttime symptoms > 2 times per month?
- Does the pt use rescue inhaler > 2 times per week?
- Does the pt ever have to limit activity due to asthma symptoms?

| Severity of asthma | Impairment over a month | FEV1 |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Intermittent** | Answer no to all of the Rule of 2s questions above. | >80% predicted |
| **Mild persistent** | Symptoms less than daily, nighttime symptoms less than weekly, SABA use less than daily, minor activity limitations | >80% predicted |
| **Moderate persistent** | Symptoms daily, nighttime symptoms >= weekly, SABA use daily, some activity limitations | 60-79% predicted |
| **Severe persistent** | Symptoms all day, nighttime symptoms every night, SABA use more than daily, extreme activity limitations | <60% predicted |

### Management

Aim to use the lowest possible step to maintain symptom control. Also consider stepping down therapy if pt has been well-controlled for >3 months

Prior to escalating therapy, consider:
- Adherence to therapy (including inhaler technique), uncontrolled comorbidities (allergies, GERD, OSA, etc), and alternative diagnoses
- Ensure pts receive MDI and spacer teaching for full effect

**Updated Guidelines:** PRN ICS - LABA > PRN SABA Step 1 (mild intermittent) and Step 2 (mild persistent). Reduces exacerbations, easier to schedule does in future if needed

### Follow-up

- Repeat PFTs q3-6 mos after beginning therapy and q1-2 yrs thereafter
- Follow-up appointment 1-3mos after initiating therapy, every 3-12 mo thereafter

### VA specific guidance:

Mometasone is the formulary ICS and Wixela (fluticasone-salmeterol) is the formulary ICS/LABA

**Ordering PFTs:** Refer to Pulm section on PFTs for VUMC and VA specifics

| Guideline | Step 1 | Step 2 | Step 3 | Step 4 | Step 5 | Step 6 |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|GINA 2023|PRN Low dose ICS-LABA (budesonide-formoterol)|PRN low-dose ICS-LABA (budesonide-formoterol)|Daily + PRN-low dose ICS-LABA|Daily medium-dose ICS-LABA + PRN low-dose ICS-LABA|Consider: High-dose ICS-LABA x3-6mo; add LAMA; or additional therapies (biologics, azithro,  or low-dose PO glucocorticoids)|N/A|
|NAEPP 2020|Intermittent: PRN SABA|Mild persistent: PRN SABA + daily low-dose ICS (budesonide). Alt: PRN SABA + daily medium-dose ICS-LABA|Moderate persistent: Daily +PRN low-dose ICS-LABA|Moderate persistent refractory: Daily + PRN medium-dose ICS-LABA|Severe persistent: Daily medium or high-dose ICS-LABA + daily LAMA + PRN SABA|Severe persistent refractory: Daily high-dose ICS-LABA + oral glucocorticoids + PRN SABA|

| Corticosteroid Potencies: |  |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Low Potency | Medium Potency | High Potency | Very High Potency |
| Desonide 0.05% (cream, lotion, ointment) | Triamcinolone (Kenalog) 0.1% (ointment, cream) | Betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% (ointment, cream, lotion) | Clobetasol 0.05% (cream, ointment, lotion, gel, foam) |

Corticosteroids: General Principles 

- Main side effects ➔ skin atrophy  
- Face and intertriginous areas ➔ low potency steroids ONLY   
- High potency steroids should be limited to 3 weeks of use 

*  Optimal absorption if applied after bathing (hydration promotes steroid penetration)   
- **Ointments** \- most potent due to occlusive effect, good for thick, hyperkeratotic lesions and areas of smooth, NON-hairy skin. Avoid hairy and intertriginous areas (can cause skin maceration and folliculitis)   
- **Creams** \- more cosmetically appealing and well tolerated. Less potent than ointments   
- **Lotions** \- Useful in hairy and intertriginous areas. Less potent than creams

**Author: Lauren Waskowicz**

### Background

Obtain a thorough history and validate the pt's concerns
- Assess chronicity: acute <1 month, subacute 1-6 months, chronic >6 months
- Thorough review of systems, as well as questions regarding lifestyle (diet/exercise/sleep and any substance use) and social factors (financial/relationship stressors)
- Assess impact on daily life and accommodations the pt has made to cope

Review medication list, age related cancer screening, prior lab values and imaging

### Common Etiologies

In otherwise well appearing individual consider first screening for:
- Anemia, iron deficiency (even if anemia isn't present)
- Liver/Kidney dysfunction
- Thyroid disease
- Mood disorder (anxiety, depression, adjustment disorder, substance use)
- Sleep Disorder (OSA, narcolepsy, REM sleep disorder, shift work disorder)

If above screening is negative or patient is not well appearing, can also consider:
- **Cardiopulmonary:** CHF, CAD/angina, PVD, obstructive lung disease
- **Endocrine:** Diabetes, adrenal insufficiency
- **Hematologic/Neoplastic:** occult malignancy
- **Infectious:** HIV, mononucleosis, hepatitis, TB, fungal, parasitic, long-covid
- **Medication Use:** opioids, benzodiazepines, antihistamines, muscle relaxants, antidepressants, beta-blockers, GABA analogues, substances
- **Rheumatologic:** fibromyalgia, PMR, SLE, RA, Sjögren's
- **Neurologic:** multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis

### Evaluation

- Complete physical exam
- Lab tests to order if >1 month duration:
  - Initial screening should include CMP, CBC w/ diff, iron studies, TSH
  - If not previously evaluated, can check HIV, hepatidities, A1c
- Assess for mood disorder (PHQ-9, GAD7)
- Assess for sleep disturbance (STOP-BANG, Epworth Sleepiness Scale) ± sleep study
- Age appropriate cancer screening if applicable
- Other considerations: family medical history, domestic violence, housing insecurity, substance use, new medications (OTC, supplements)

### Management

- Treatment is largely specific to underlying etiology of fatigue (if found)
- Etiology may never be identified; if undiagnosed for >6 mo, consider myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) as a diagnosis of exclusion
- Consider empiric trial of antidepressant (SSRI/SNRI/Bupropion) in those with residual/idiopathic fatigue and depressed mood – even if pt does not meet MDD criteria
- Consider referral to long-COVID clinic if symptom timeline indicative of post-covid exposure

## Gender Affirming Care

**Author: Lauren Waskowicz**

### Documentation:

- Always ask the patients preferred names and pronouns, document preferred name in eSTAR (see below) and document pronouns, sexual orientation and gender in "Gender and Sexuality" tab found in the drop down menu on the right side of upper dashboard
- Patient's legal name and sex should be reflected in the chart, if patient legally changes sex and gender marker, epic officially can reflect that
- If not, document preferred name in the patient header as below:
  - Click Patient's Name on eSTAR header to pull up demographics
  - In the box with the patient's name there is this symbol ≡, clicking this will bring up a box that will allow you to enter a "preferred name" which will then populate to the patient header
  - Edit your outpatient schedule preferences to show preferred name as a column, click on the cogwheels in your whiteboard, move "pref name" over to the right for selected columns

- Sexual History: Ask the patient's permission to discuss sexual history, be sure to normalize it and make it a part of every new patient visit.

  - 6 Ps:
    - **Partners:** How many partners in the past 6 months and how do partners identify (male, female, non-binary etc.)
    - **Practices:** Type of sex (oral, anal, vaginal). If anal sex, does the patient participate in receptive, penetrative or both practices
    - **Protection:** Protection from STI (abstinence, monogamy, barrier)
    - **Past History of STI:** Was STI treated and was a test of cure performed
    - **Pregnancy Intention/Prevention:** Is patient/partner trying to conceive, if not, what methods are they using for contraception
    - **Plus:** History of sexual trauma/violence, concerns/satisfaction

### Starting Gender Affirming Hormones

(John Hopkins Quick Guide: https://ipng.us/GAHT-guide)

#### First 1-2 Visits:

- **Collect Gender History:**
  - Ask patient goals - what do they hope to achieve with Gender Affirming Hormone Therapy
  - Are they interested in surgery → Refer as appropriate (see below for referrals)
  - Fertility goals? Recommend sperm banking for trans women, evidence less clear that testosterone affects future fertility in transmen, but egg harvesting still recommended
  - Contraceptive needs (Gender Affirming Hormone Therapy IS NOT birth control) → consider progesterone only options in transmen
  - Interest in hair removal (required for most bottom surgeries), speech therapy

- **Comprehensive History and Physical:**
  - Assess health conditions which might be influenced by GAHT: e.g. smoking (VTE risk for AMAB), DM, HTN, HLD, CAD, polycythemia, OSA
  - Medication reconciliation for interactions (can contact VIVID PharmD Dylan Hughes on eSTAR with questions)
  -  Assess social and sexual health needs
  - Obtain Baseline Labs (CBC, CMP, estradiol, total testosterone, lipids, a1C)

- **Assess capacity for consent, start informed consent process:**
  - Consent may be verbal or written (MedEx Consent form - "Consent Estrogen Hormone Therapy" OR "Consent Testosterone Hormone Therapy")

- **Write first prescription** (3-6 month supply) & needles (if needed)

#### Follow Up Visits: (first year q3m, second year q6m then yearly)

- Ask about physical and emotional changes (see chart for expected time course)
- Assess for side effects
  - Injection site reactions
  - Transgender Male: acne, hair loss (consider finasteride), genital dryness 2/2 atrophy (consider topical E)
  - Transgender Female: dizziness/hypotension from spiro (consider alternate blocker)
- Check Blood pressure and CBC, CMP, estradiol, total testosterone (check hormone levels midcycle if using injections)
-	There are varying opinions on the actual importance/relevance of monitoring hormone levels (the following recommendations are from Endocrine society):
    -	For Feminizing hormones: Estradiol goal of 100-200pg/mL, testosterone <55
    -	For Masculinizing hormones: Testosterone goal of 400-700ng/dL
    -	Adjust hormone doses as needed (see table below)
    -	Revisit gender affirming goals → Refer as appropriate

## Hypertension (HTN)

**Author: Audrey White**

### Background

- 47% of adults in the US have HTN, yet only 24% of adults with HTN have adequate BP control (2021)
- HTN is associated with ↑CVD risk and is the most prevalent modifiable risk factor for CVD

### Definitions

- **ACC/AHA 2017:** BP ≥ 130/80 or taking antihypertensive medication
- **Resistant HTN:** uncontrolled BP despite taking 3 antihypertensive medications (including a diuretic) OR ≥ 4 total medications
- **Whitecoat HTN:** elevated office BP but normal readings when measured with ambulatory or home blood pressure monitoring (ABPM/HBPM)

| Hypertension by ABPM/HBPM |  |  |  |
|-|-|-|-|
|||Yes|No|
| Hypertension by office BP |Yes|Sustained hypertension |White coat hypertension |
| Hypertension by office BP |No|Masked hypertension |Sustained normotension|

### Screening

- Screen all adults >18. Less frequent screening (q3-5 yrs) is appropriate for adults 18-39 without risk factors and previously normal BP. More frequent screening (q6-12mo) for adults ≥40 or with risk factors (USPSTF Grade A)
- **Risk factors:** older age, black race, family history, excess weight/obesity, lifestyle habits (lack of physical activity, stress, tobacco use, alcohol use), dietary factors (high salt or high fat diet)
- Consider screening for masked HTN with ABPM/HBPM if SBP 120-129 mmHg in office + risk factors (ACC/AHA 2017)

### Diagnosis

**Proper measurement:** Avoid caffeine/smoking 30 min prior and empty bladder. Have pt sit quietly at rest for 5 min with legs uncrossed. Place proper sized cuff on exposed arm, supported at heart level.

Hypertension by office BP (≥130/80) and hypertension out of office confirmed by ABPM or HBPM, as follows:
- Daytime mean: SBP ≥ 130 or DBP ≥ 80
- Nighttime mean: SBP ≥ 110 or DBP ≥ 65
- 24 hr mean: SBP ≥ 125 or DBP ≥ 75

If ABPM not possible, 2-3 outpt measurements at 1-4 week intervals are required to confirm diagnosis

A diagnosis can be made without confirmatory readings in these circumstances:
- HTN urgency or emergency: SBP ≥ 180 or DBP ≥ 120
- Initial SBP ≥ 160 or DBP ≥ 100 and evidence of end-organ damage (LV hypertrophy, HTN retinopathy, ischemic CVD, CKD)

### Evaluation

- Perform in all pts with newly diagnosed HTN:
  - BMP, fasting glucose, CBC, lipid profile, UA, TSH, EKG
  - Calculate 10 yr ASCVD risk

- Distinguish between primary (90% incidence) vs. secondary HTN (10%)

- Suspect 1º (essential) HTN: gradual onset, family hx, associated risk factors

- Suspect 2º: unusual presentation (new diagnosis in young/elderly, abrupt, exacerbation in previously controlled HTN), drug-resistant, or the presence of clinical clue (abdominal bruit in renovascular HTN, hypokalemia in hyperaldosteronism)

- Assess for end organ damage: retinopathy (eye exam), CVD/LV hypertrophy, HF (TTE), CKD (urine Alb:Cr), PAD (ABI)

| Common 2º Causes | Suggestive Features | Diagnostic Testing |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Drug or alcohol induced | History of substance use (cocaine, caffeine, nicotine, medications) | USD, BP improvement after withdrawal of suspected agent |
| Medication induced | Steroids, OCPs, sympathomimetic, SNRI/TCA, atypical antipsychotics | BP improvement after withdrawal of suspected substance |
| OSA | Apneic events, somnolence, obesity, increased neck circumference | Polysomnography |
| Primary hyperaldosteronism | Hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis | Plasma aldosterone/renin levels (not reliable if taking MRA, adjust dx threshold if taking ACEi/ARB)|
| Primary kidney disease | Hypervolemia, increased Cr, abnormal UA, FHx kidney disease| UA, Urine Albumin:Cr, Renal US |
| Renovascular disease (RAS or FMD) | Abdominal bruit, increased Cr after ACEi/ARB, young age, severe HTN w/ onset > 55yo, flash pulmonary edema | Doppler renal US |

**Uncommon 2º causes:** Pheochromocytoma, Cushing's syndrome, thyroid dysfunction, aortic coarctation, primary hyperparathyroidism, acromegaly, congenital adrenal hyperplasia

### Management

**ACA-AHA Guidelines (2017) based on SPRINT trial

|  |  |  |
|-------|---------------------|------------|
| Elevated BP | SBP 120-129 mmHg AND DBP < 80 mmHg | Lifestyle modifications: Reassess in 3-6 months |
| Stage 1 | SBP 130-139 mmHg OR DBP 80-89 mmHg | Lifestyle modifications: If CVD, T2D, CKD, age ≥ 65 or ASCVD risk ≥ 10%, add anti-HTN med. Reassess monthly until BP goal is met then measure q3-6months |
| Stage 2 | SBP ≥140 mmHg OR DBP ≥90 mmHg | Lifestyle modifications and 1-2 anti-HTN meds. Reassess monthly until BP goal is met, then measure q3-6months |

### Therapy goals

- Adults over 60 years: target BP varies by guideline. Consider CVD risk and comorbidities (e.g., stroke) to decide target BP.
- White coat HTN: lifestyle modification & CVD risk reduction
- Masked HTN: treatment guided by out-of-office BP measurements
- Diastolic HTN: treat to prevent LVH and HFpEF
- **BP target:**
  - <130/80 mmHg: general population
  - <140/90 (less aggressive goal): frail pts with orthostatic hypotension, limited life expectancy

If not meeting goals, combination therapy > doubling a single agent. **Preferred combinations:**
- ACEi/ARB + CCB
- ACEi/ARB + CCB + thiazide
- ACEi/ARB + CCB + MRA
- Do NOT combine BB and non-dihydropyridine CCB

### Non-pharmacological lifestyle interventions: indicated for all pts regardless of stage

- **8-14 mmHg ↓:** DASH diet (fresh produce, whole grains, low-fat dairy)
- **5-10 mmHg ↓:** weight loss (10kg or 22lbs), expect 1 mmHg for every 1kg reduction in body weight
- **3-9 mmHg ↓:** Na+ restriction (1.5g/d), aerobic exercise for 90-150 min/week, increased intake of K+ rich foods
- **2-4 mmHg ↓:** moderate EtOH (2 drinks/day for men; 1 drink/day for women)
- **Medication changes:** consider transitioning offending medications
- **Tobacco cessation:** smoking increases risk of masked HTN, renovascular HTN, severe hypertensive retinopathy, and arterial stiffness

### Pharmacologic therapy

- Initial monotherapy: ACEi/ARB, dihydropyridine CCB, or thiazides
- Degree of BP reduction (not type of medication) is the major determinant of CVD risk reduction
- There is controversial evidence in using race to determine therapy. Some studies suggest the benefit of CCB or thiazides in black pts

| Drug Class | Common Drugs | Side Effects and Comments |
|------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Thiazide diuretics** | HCTZ 12.5-25 mg; Chlorthalidone 12.5-25 mg (preferred agent based on RCT but ↑ risk of electrolyte abnormalities) | HypoNa, hypoMg, hypoK, ↑ uric acid, hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension. Contraindicated in pregnancy. |
| **Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)** | Lisinopril, benazepril, fosinopril, quinapril (all 5-40 mg daily); Ramipril: 2.5-20 mg in 1-2 doses | Angioedema (more common in AA), AKI, hyperK, cough. Contraindicated in pregnancy |
| **Angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)** | Losartan 25 - 100 mg in 1-2 doses; Candesartan 8 - 32 mg in 1-2 doses; Irbesartan 150 - 300 mg; Valsartan 80 - 320 mg | AKI, hyperK, angioedema (less frequent than ACEi); Less side effects than ACEi; Contraindicated in pregnancy |
| **Calcium channel blocker (CCB)** | **Dihydropyridine:** Amlodipine 2.5-10 mg in 1-2 doses; Nifedipine 30-120 mg in 1-2 doses; **Nondihydropyridine:** Diltiazem ER 120-360 mg; Verapamil ER 120-480 mg | **Dihydropyridine:** peripheral edema, worsening proteinuria; **Nondihydropyridine:** constipation, heart block if used with BB; Amlodipine is safe but not first line for HFrEF; Other CCBs may worsen outcomes in HFrEF |
| **Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA)** | Spironolactone 12.5 - 50 mg; Eplerenone 25 - 50 mg | Good choice for resistant HTN; AKI, hyperkalemia; Spironolactone/gynecomastia and secondary sexual side effects |
| **Beta blocker (BB)** | Atenolol 25-100mg in 1-2 doses; Carvedilol 6.25-25 mg BID; Metoprolol succinate 25 - 200 mg daily; Nebivolol 5 - 10 mg; Labetalol 100 - 300 BID | Reserve for CHF/CAD/arrhythmia; Hyperglycemia, fatigue, low HR; beta1-selective (atenolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol) may be safer in pts with COPD, asthma, diabetes |
| **Vasodilators** | Hydralazine 25-100 mg in 2-4 doses; Minoxidil 5-10 mg in 3-4 doses | Reserve for HTN resistant to optimized 4-drug regimen; Reflex tachycardia, fluid retention, SLE-like reaction |
| **Centrally-acting agents (alpha 2 agonists)** | Clonidine 0.1-0.6 mg daily, (Weekly transdermal patch 0.1-0.3mg is preferred to avoid non-adherence and subsequent reflex HTN); Methyldopa 250-500 mg daily | Reserve for resistant HTN; Rebound HTN and withdrawal |
| **Loop diuretics** | Furosemide 20-160mg daily; Torsemide 10-100mg daily, Bumetanide 0.5-3.0mg daily | Reserve for HTN and volume overloaded states; AKI, hypovolemia, hypoK, hypoMg |

| Conditions | Drug Class |
|------------|--------|
| Heart failure | ACEi/ARB or ARNI + BB + MRA + diuretics |
| CAD | ACEi/ARB or BB |
| Diabetes | All first line agents; ACEi/ARB if presence of albuminuria |
| CKD | ACEi/ARB |
| Recurrent stroke prevention | ACEi/ARB, thiazide |
| Pregnancy | nifedipine, labetalol, methyldopa |

## Lipids

**Author: Leonie Dupuis**

### Background

- **1º prevention:** pts at increased risk who have not yet had a vascular event
- **2º prevention:** pts with pre-existing occlusive vascular disease or ASCVD (e.g. stroke, TIA, CAD + angina, ACS, coronary or arterial revascularization, PAD)
- **Screening:** All adults ≥ 20y
  - USPSTF 2016 Guidelines: q5years for adults 40-75yrs
  - ACC/AHA 2019 Guideline: adults 20-39 q4-6yrs; <21yrs if strong fam hx; 40-75 "routinely" assess CV risk and calculate ASCVD risk (dot phrase .ASCVD2013)

### Evaluation

- Fasting not routinely needed unless evaluating for hyperTG; if non-fasting TG >440, then obtain 12-14h fasting panel
- Consider 2º causes of HLD in initial workup: hypothyroidism, DM, EtOH use, smoking, liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, CKD, meds (e.g. thiazide, glucocorticoids)
- In pts with borderline ASCVD risk (5%-7.5% risk) or hesitant to take statins with low risk, CAC score can help with shared decision making. Therapy is recommended.
- Check lipoprotein(a) (once in a lifetime) in pts with personal or family history of ASCVD, or in pts with less than expected LDL lowering after starting a statin.

### Management

**Lifestyle changes:** weight loss, exercise, smoking cessation, limiting alcohol
- Diet low in sat. fat a/w 15-20 mg/dL ↓ in LDL-C, ~50% ↓risk of CAD
- **Diet Avoiding:** trans/saturated fats (red meat, processed meat, butter, cheese), sodium (<2300 mg/day) and sugar-sweetened foods and beverages
- **Diet Emphasizing:** vegetables, fruits, legumes, lean protein, whole grains, nuts

Figure from 2018 ACC/AHA Guideline for the management of primary prevention :
https://www.ahajournals.org/cms/asset/c4c7b8c7-5c95-40d4-9919-be9c725b5ea9/e1082fig02.gif

Figure from 2018 ACC/AHA Guideline for the management of secondary prevention: 
https://www.ahajournals.org/cms/asset/0882d0f2-9af3-4bfa-aefe-c21d406f82be/e1082fig01.jpg

### Statin Therapy

- Check AST/ALT prior to initiation
- Note that ASCVD risk equation is best validated for non-Hispanic whites and blacks. Consider use of additional risk prediction tools/factors in other pt populations
- Lipid panel should be checked 6-8 weeks following initial statin to ensure LDL-C has fallen 30-50%. After this, consider checking lipid panel yearly to assess adherence.

| Statin Class | Statin and Dose |
|------------------|--------------|
| High-Intensity (≥50% ↓LDL-C) | **Atorvastatin 40-80mg**, **Rosuvastatin 20-40mg** |
| Moderate-Intensity (30-49% ↓LDL-C) | **Atorvastatin 10-20mg**, **Rosuvastatin 5-10mg**, **Simvastatin 20-40mg**, **Pravastatin 40-80mg**, **Lovastatin 40**-80mg, Fluvastatin XL 80mg, **Fluvastatin 40mg BID**, Pitavastatin 1-4mg |
| Low-Intensity (<30% ↓LDL-C)) | Simvastatin 10mg, **Pravastatin 10-20mg**, **Lovastatin 20mg**, Fluvastatin 20-40mg |
||*Dosing with RCT-proven LDL-lowering benefit is bolded|

**Statin properties:**
- Safest in CKD: atorvastatin, fluvastatin (no renal dose required)
- Safest in cirrhosis: pravastatin
- Lowest rate of myopathy: pravastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin
- Lower overall side effects: pravastatin, rosuvastatin (both are hydrophilic)
- Biggest change in LDL: rosuvastatin followed by atorvastatin then simvastatin

### Statin Side effects:

**Spectrum of statin associated muscle symptoms (SAMS)** include myalgias, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, autoimmune myopathy
- **Myalgias:** bilateral involving large muscle groups, onset within weeks of initiation of therapy and should resolve within weeks of cessation; CK should be normal
- Consider evaluation with CK, BMP, TSH, and vitamin D
- "ACC Statin Intolerance Calculator" can help assess etiology of symptoms

### Additional Information

If pt is not tolerating a statin, consider:
- Holding statin until symptoms resolve and trialing lower dose or other statin
- Every other day dosing with rosuvastatin (longer half-life and hydrophilic)
- If repeated failed attempts, consider ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitor

Consider adding ezetimibe if pt has very high ASCVD and LDL >70 while on maximally tolerated high-intensity statin

PCSK9 inhibitor requires referral to Lipid Clinic

### Hypertriglyceridemia

- **Moderate:** TG 175-499 mg/dL; **Moderate-severe** 500 - 999; **Severe:** TG > 1000
- Focus on addressing lifestyle factors and stopping medication that increase TG's (HCTZ, some BB's, estrogens, some ART, antipsychotics)
- Consider medical therapy when TG> 500mg/dL (increased risk of pancreatitis)
  - Omega-3-fatty acids (icosapent ethyl) 4gms daily or Vascepa 4gm daily
  - Fibrates: fenofibrate 120 mg daily (avoid in CKD), gemfibrozil 600mg BID (increased risk of myopathy with concomitant statin)

### VA Specific guidance:

https://www.pbm.va.gov/PBM/clinicalguidance/criteriaforuse/Dyslipidemia_CFU.pdf

- Lowest LDL goal recognized for VA Criteria for Use is 100
- **Preferred statins:** atorvastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin

## Obesity and Weight Management

| Class | BMI |
|-------|-----|
| Underweight | < 18.5 |
| Normal | 18.5 – 24.9 |
| Overweight | 25.0 – 29.9 |
| Obese | Class I: 30.0 – 34.9; Class II: 35.0 – 39.9; Class III: >40 |

### Background

- BMI = Body Weight (kg) / Height (meters)²
- 42% of US adults are obese. 74% of adults are overweight or obese.

### Evaluation

- **USPTF:** Pts with BMI >30 should be offered or referred to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions
- **Screen for co-morbidities:** HTN (BP), HLD (lipid panel), DM (A1c), MAFLD (LFTs), OSA (polysomnography), consider TSH if other symptoms of thyroid dysfunction

### Management

**Goals:**
- Target weight loss of 5-7% body weight
- An average deficit of 500 kcal/day should result in an initial weight loss of ~0.5 kg/week (1 lb/week)
- Even weight loss of 3-5% produces clinically meaningful health benefits
- Regaining weight is common, schedule frequent follow up to assess and encourage progress
- Have pts keep a food log or recall last 24 hrs of food history in clinic
- Limit high caloric beverages and processed foods first
- Encourage accountability partners
- Share MyPlate information
- Consider weight loss apps: My Fitness Pal, Lose it, Noom

**Dietary options:**
- Total calorie restriction is the most effective dietary intervention for weight loss
- Generally, encourage patients to pursue whatever dietary intervention is most sustainable for their lifestyles
- Mediterranean diet: high in fresh vegetables/fruits, whole grains, legumes, unsaturated fats, moderate diary and EtOH, less meat
  - Associated with decreased overall mortality and CV mortality, may decrease DM incidence independent of weight loss
- DASH diet: 4-5 servings of fruit, 4-5 servings of vegetables, 2-3 servings of lowfat dairy per day, and <25 percent dietary intake from fat
  - Associated with decreases in SBP and DBP
- There is mixed evidence for intermittent fasting, low carb, low fat, and high protein diets

**Exercise: goal >30 min, 5-7 days per week**
- Ideally combination of aerobic and resistance training
- Exercise alone is not sufficient for weight loss. Associated with maintaining weight loss

**Pharmacotherapy**
- BMI ≥30 or ≥27 with co-morbidity
- Leads to significant short term weight loss, high rates of rebound, weight gain

**Bariatric Surgery:**
- Indicated for patients with BMI >40 or >35 with obesity related co-morbidity and failed lifestyle intervention
- Referral to Surgical Weight Loss Clinic

**Medical Weight Loss Clinic:**
- Can refer for patient with BMI >30 or >27 with obesity related co-morbidity
- VA: Consider referral to MOVE program (in-person or telehealth options)
