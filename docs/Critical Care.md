## Definition of Shock

**Author: Jessica Reed**

**Shock** is the clinical syndrome defined by inadequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation leading to cellular and organ dysfunction.

### Shock Subtypes (further characterized in sections below)

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Distributive** | Septic, anaphylactic, neurogenic, and rarely endocrine emergencies (adrenal crisis, hypothyroidism) |
| **Cardiogenic** | Cardiomyopathies, arrhythmias, severe valvular diseases, acute MI |
| **Hypovolemic** | Bleeding, volume deplete states |
| **Obstructive** | PE, tension PTX, cardiac tamponade |

### Clinical Signs of Shock and Key Diagnostic Findings

**Shock = Hypotension¹ + Signs of Hypoperfusion² + Laboratory Markers³**

1. **Systolic BP <90 mm Hg or mean arterial pressure (MAP) <60 mm Hg for more than 30 minutes (sustained),** or the requirement of vasopressors to maintain SBP ≥90 mm Hg or MAP ≥60 mm Hg. Often, but not always, with associated tachycardia pending underlying etiology

2. **Clinical signs of tissue hypoperfusion:**
   - **Neurologic:** AMS, decreased mentation with possible obtundation, disorientation or confusion
   - **Cutaneous:** Cool extremities, clammy skin w/peripheral vasoconstriction and cyanosis, and poor cap refill (note: distributive shock often has warm extremities with some signs of vasodilation)
   - **Renal:** Urine output <30 mL/h or of <0.5ml/kg of body weight/hr

3. **Hyperlactatemia** (which indicates abnormal cellular oxygen metabolism) and other markers of organ dysfunction such as impaired renal function (AKI), elevated liver function tests (shock liver), and metabolic acidosis

## Management of Shock

**Author: Brian Haimerl**

### Cardiogenic Shock

#### Background:
- **Pathophysiology:** Primary insult (see etiologies) -> CO/CI decreased -> systemic hypoperfusion -> compensatory mechanisms including increased SVR and fluid retention -> further reduction of CO
- **PA catheter findings:** Typically, high PCWP >15mmHg (can be low/normal in right heart failure), low CO (CI <2.8 L/min/m²), high SVR (>1400 dynes/sec/cm⁵) and SvO2 <65%
- **Etiologies:** Acute MI, cardiomyopathy (LHF, RHF or biventricular), arrhythmia, mechanical such as acute AR (ex: dissection) or MR (ex: ruptured papillary muscle), myocarditis, blunt cardiac trauma

#### Presentation:
- **"Cold and wet"** - cold and clammy skin/limbs, weak/nonpalpable distal pulses, edematous, elevated JVP; narrow pulse pressure; hypoxia w/crackles and pulmonary edema on CXR; POCUS with plump, non-collapsable IVC, reduced EF, and B-lines
- ***Patients can be normotensive and still in cardiogenic shock w/ end-organ hypoperfusion***

#### Management
See "cardiogenic shock" in the Cardiology section

---

### Distributive Shock

#### Background:
- **Pathophysiology:** Severe, peripheral vasodilation
  - CO/CI increased, SVR decreased, PCWP and RAP normal to low, SvO2 >65%
- **Etiologies:** Sepsis (most common), anaphylaxis, neurogenic, adrenal insufficiency, pancreatitis

#### Signs/symptoms:
- **Sepsis:** Localizing signs of infection; tachycardia, tachypnea, may be hypo/hyperthermic; POCUS with hyperdynamic cardiac function
- **Anaphylaxis:** History of anaphylaxis; urticaria, edema, diarrhea, wheezing on exam
- **Neurogenic:** History of CNS trauma; focal neurologic deficits on exam, associated bradycardia
- **Adrenal insufficiency:** History of chronic steroid use, may have GI symptoms, hyponatremia (common), hyperkalemia (rare), hypoglycemia, hypo/hyperthermia, NAGMA
- **Pancreatitis:** Abdominal pain with radiation to back, elevated lipase, evidence on CT scan

#### Management:
- **Sepsis:** See "Sepsis" in Infectious Disease
- **Anaphylaxis:** 0.3mg IM epinephrine (0.01mg/kg, max 0.5mg) ASAP to be repeated q5-15min x 3; IVF boluses for supportive treatment; after third IM epi, consider epi gtt (1-10 mcg/min) if persistent hypotension. Adjuncts: Albuterol nebs for bronchospasm, H1 and H2 blockers, glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone 1mg/kg). **EPINEPHRINE SAVES LIVES.**
- **Neurogenic:** Caution with IVF resuscitation, can worsen cerebral and spinal cord edema; preferred pressor is norepinephrine; for neurogenic shock 2/2 spinal cord pathology, consider higher MAP goal 85-90 mmHg for 7 days to improve spinal cord perfusion
- **Adrenal insufficiency:** Stress dose steroids with hydrocortisone – initial dose of 100mg IV followed by 50mg q6h. IVF resuscitation.
  - NOTE: Adrenal crisis NEVER comes out of nowhere; look for precipitating factor (missed medication, infection, trauma, surgery, or stressors)
- **Pancreatitis:** IVF + pressors; trend H/H, BUN, and Ca; treat complications (necrotizing pancreatitis, abdominal compartment syndrome); address underlying etiology (see "Acute Pancreatitis" in GI section)

---

### Hypovolemic Shock

#### Background
- **Etiologies:** Hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic

#### Signs/symptoms:
- **Hemorrhagic:** Common sources include GI, retroperitoneal (*needs high index of suspicion), traumatic, intraabdominal, thighs, thorax.
- **Non-hemorrhagic:** 2/2 GI losses or decreased PO intake
- POCUS with thin, collapsible IVC

#### Management (Hemorrhagic)
- Ensure good access with two large-bore (at least 18G) IVs ideally in AC or above; Cordis or MAC CVC (can also use dialysis catheter, if necessary)
- **Hyperacute bleed:**
  - 1:1:1 ratio FFP:Plt:RBC (balanced resuscitation), trauma blood (fastest way to get RBCs); massive transfusion protocol (MTP)
  - Monitor iCa and replete (citrated blood products will deplete Ca)
  - Minimize crystalloid if possible, w/primary use to prevent immediate hemodynamic collapse (contributes to coagulopathy, hypothermia, acidemia, trauma/surgery)
  - Permissive hypotension until source control/transfusions with arterial bleeds (high MAP/SBP -> clot destabilization); trend POC lactate/exam to guide
  - Acute traumatic arterial bleed or post-partum hemorrhage consider TXA (1-2g bolus)
  - Reverse anticoagulation, if applicable
  - Vasopressors -> generally poorly effective, would start with norepinephrine
  - Source control -> GI, IR, or EGS
- **Variceal bleed:** See GI Bleeding section for specific management

#### Management (Non-Hemorrhagic)
- Aggressive IVF resuscitation (balanced crystalloid); target MAP ≥65
- Can support BP during resuscitation with pressors (usually norepinephrine)

### Obstructive Shock
See dedicated section below

---

## Obstructive Shock

**Author: Hannah Kieffer**

### Background
- Obstructive shock occurs when there is increased resistance to forward blood flow. This can occur due to:
  - Resistance in the pulmonary/cardiovascular circuit (i.e., pulmonary embolism, intracardiac mass)
  - Extrinsic compression on the heart and decreased diastolic filling (i.e., pericardial tamponade, tension pneumothorax, dynamic hyperinflation (auto-PEEP))

### Risk factors vary based on the underlying pathology:
- **PE:** Known DVT, prothrombotic conditions, malignancy, recent orthopedic surgery or prolonged travel; family history of clots/thrombophilia
- **Pneumothorax:** Recent chest trauma/thoracic procedures, mechanical ventilation, COPD/emphysema, endobronchial valve placement
- **Tamponade:** Recent cardiac procedure, ESRD, cancer, trauma, rheumatologic diseases

### Approach in the Hemodynamically Unstable Patient

#### Initial workup:
- Evaluate the patient at bedside and bring an ultrasound if available to perform POCUS
- Orders: STAT CBC, CMP, EKG, BNP, troponin, VBG, lactate, d-dimer, CXR

#### Supportive measures:
- Consider fluid administration, especially if concerned that patient is preload dependent (e.g. cardiac tamponade)
- Perform passive leg test (compare cardiac output/blood pressure between patient lying at 45 degrees and patient to lying back with both legs raised) or trial small fluid bolus to test for fluid responsiveness
- Try to avoid vasopressors since increasing afterload could aggravate obstructive shock. However, if vital, can consider norepinephrine vs vasopressin to maintain lowest necessary MAP (both thought to have lesser effect on pulmonary vasculature)
- If ventilated, aim for low volume and low PEEP settings to minimize afterload on the right ventricle

### Clinical Signs/Symptoms:
- **General:** Hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxemia, elevated JVP, cold extremities
- **Tension pneumothorax:** Unilateral breath sounds, asymmetrical chest rise, CXR with one lung collapsed, tracheal deviation/mediastinal shift away from the pneumothorax
- **Pulmonary embolism:** Chest pain, hypoxia, sense of impending doom. On EKG: Most common is sinus tachycardia but look for right heart strain (right axis deviation, S1Q3T3, ST depressions in inferior leads/precordial leads, new RBBB)
- **Cardiac tamponade:** Beck's Triad (distant heart sounds, JVD, and hypotension), electrical alternans, low amplitude on EKG, pulsus paradoxus (drop in systolic blood pressure by >10 mmHg during inspiration)

### POCUS findings:
- **PE:** Distended IVC, RV dilation, McConnell's sign, Septal D sign, underfilled LV
- **Pneumothorax:** Lack of lung sliding
- **Cardiac tamponade:** Diastolic collapse of the RV, large pericardial effusion

### Further Evaluation and Management by most common etiologies:

#### Pulmonary Embolism
**Evaluation:** STAT CTA PE

**Management:**
- Supportive measures: vasopressors, supplemental O2
- Start high-dose therapeutic heparin gtt if high suspicion even before clot has been identified/confirmed, with heparin bolus unless contraindicated (i.e., recent GI bleed)
  - NOTE: First line is LMWH due to faster onset of action and longer time in therapeutic range. At VUMC, we often start heparin gtt first because if pt is going for EKOS, they need to be able to turn off AC quickly. We recommend starting heparin gtt until decision for EKOS has been made. If no EKOS, switch to LMWH
- If massive PE, activate PERT (PE Response Team) for discussion regarding mechanical thrombectomy or chemical thrombolysis
  - Call "1-1111" and state "that your pt has a massive PE"/"activate PERT"
- Look for the source for the embolism (four extremity dopplers)
- If no risk factors for VTE are identified, consider a benign hematology outpatient referral for a hypercoagulable work-up
- See "Pulmonary Embolism" in Cardiology section for more information

#### Cardiac tamponade:
**Evaluation:** Cardiac POCUS, follow up with formal echo

**Management:**
- Supportive measures: Support preload; IV fluid bolus to temporarily improve cardiac output. AVOID diuretics, venodilators, and proning
- If un-stable, STAT consult cardiothoracic surgery for procedural management (pericardiocentesis vs drain)
- If stable, consult cardiology and/or cardiothoracic surgery

#### Tension pneumothorax:
**Evaluation:** Chest POCUS (look for lack of lung sliding), STAT CXR

**Management:**
- **If acutely unstable:** Emergent needle decompression
  - 14-16 gauge needle (7-8cm long) in 5th intercostal space at the mid-axillary line (5th ICS-MAL) vs 2nd intercostal space mid-clavicular line (2nd ICS-MCL)
  - ATLS guidelines recommend 5th ICS-MAL since some studies suggest improved success rate and lower risk of complications (hitting major vessel) but data is not definitive
  - Can consider 2nd ICS-MCL when left sided if small body habitus and c/f cardiac puncture
- Otherwise, urgent chest tube placement with pulmonology (if at the VA overnight, ED attending can place one)
- Once stabilized, consult to pulmonology for chest tube placement is indicated in large, hemodynamically significant pneumothorax to ensure resolution.
- For more on chest tubes, see "Chest Tubes" in Pulmonary

## Sepsis

**Authors: Jacob Lee, Jessica Reed**

### Definitions (Sepsis 3):
- **Sepsis:** Organ dysfunction (change in total SOFA score ≥ 2 points) from dysregulated host response to infection
- **Septic shock:** Sepsis + vasopressor requirement to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg + serum lactate > 2 mEq/dL despite adequate volume resuscitation

### Evaluation: Early screening for/identification of infection

**Screening:** preferably incorporate multiple
- **SIRS, NEWS, MEWS** superior to qSOFA as single-agent-screening tools (more sensitive)
  - **SIRS:**
    - RR >20/min
    - T <36°C or > 38°C
    - HR >90 bpm
    - WBC <4 or >12x10⁹/L or >10% bands
- **SOFA** (less sensitive, more specific): PaO2/FiO2, Thrombocytopenia, Hyperbilirubinemia, Hypotension, AMS, Kidney Injury, UOP.

**Source Evaluation:**
- Cultures before starting antibiotics is preferred. However, do not delay antibiotics for cultures if unable to obtain them promptly.
- Blood cx x2 (preferably from peripheral veins via venipuncture), Urine cx. Culture from central access points if present and patient is newly being admitted
- Consider sputum cx, wound cx, other body fluid cx (thoracentesis, paracentesis, LP, joint aspiration) based on clinical picture
- Make sure to do a full body physical exam to assess for SSTI/obvious wounds.
- Provide source control as soon as possible; Limitations to source control: lines, drains, catheters, ports, hardware, etc.

**Labs:** Lactate, CBC w/ diff, BMP, HFP
- Consider DIC labs for septic shock if clinical suspicion (LDH, Haptoglobin, Fibrinogen, PT, PTT, INR)

**Imaging:** X-ray, CT, or US depending on suspected source

### Management: After screening, early antibiotic administration and fluid resuscitation

#### Antibiotics: Earlier = better (septic shock – within 1 hour; sepsis alone – within 3 hours)

**Empiric treatments:** should target organisms based on suspected source

- **MRSA coverage:** Vancomycin/daptomycin (unless PNA suspected)/linezolid/ceftaroline
  - **Risk factors for MRSA:** Previous MRSA infection, known MRSA colonization, close contact with MRSA, cavitation on CXR, dialysis, immunosuppressed, recent antibiotics, recent hospitalization, recent influenza illness

- **Pseudomonas coverage:** Piperacillin-tazobactam/cefepime/gentamicin
  - Preferred for sicker patients with MDR risk factors (recent antibiotics, recent hospitalization, immunosuppression, hemodialysis)

- **Fungal coverage:** Fluconazole/micafungin
  - **Fluconazole/micafungin:** If high risk for candida (neutropenic, receiving TPN, abdominal surgery, recent antibiotic usage, >1 site of colonization)
  - **Voriconazole/itraconazole:** If high risk for aspergillus (asthma with hemoptysis, nodules/cavitations on lung imaging)
  - **Liposomal amphotericin** if high risk for mucor/Rhizopus or disseminated crypto (uncontrolled DM with sinus pain/proptosis, uncontrolled HIV, immunosuppression with nodules on lung imaging)

- **MDR coverage:** if prior MDR infection (-penem) or high risk (dual Gram-Negative coverage)
  - During the day, will need ID attending approval. Overnight, can order one dose but will need ID approval for following doses

- **Anaerobic coverage:** Metronidazole/Piperacillin-tazobactam/Ampicillin-sulbactam/Clindamycin
  - Recommended for lung abscess or empyema and intra-abdominal infections
  - Generally, not recommended for aspiration PNA (low quality evidence, guidelines mixed). Consider if poor dentition and higher likelihood of anaerobic involvement

- **Atypical coverage:** Consider if concern for community respiratory source (Azithromycin/Levofloxacin/Doxycycline); should be given to any patient admitted to ICU for community-acquired pneumonia

**Source Control:** If unable to find source despite routine imaging, could consider PET vs tagged WBC scan

**De-escalation:** When source control obtained, use susceptibilities, MRSA nasal swab results, and clinical evaluation to decide how and when to de-escalate and discontinue antimicrobials; procalcitonin trend may also be helpful in certain clinical situations

#### Fluids: 
Initial resuscitation with at least 30 mL/kg (ideal body weight) of balanced IV crystalloid fluid (prefer LR > NS), given within the first 3 hours.
- Assess fluid responsiveness with an intravascular volume assessment (leg raise, US IVC, pulse pressure)
- **Blood:** When Hb < 7 or active and large volume bleed (Hb <8 for CAD, brisk bleed suspected)

### Post-Resuscitation Management:

#### Access:
- **Arterial line:** Preferred for hemodynamic monitoring when in shock
- **Central line:** For pressor administration
  - Can run peripherally if line is above the AC, levophed is running less than 15 mcg/min, and if needing for <48 hours

#### Vasopressors: Start if MAPs persistently < 65 mmHg after fluid resuscitation
- Via CVC, PICC, or Port, or sometimes briefly peripherally (see above)
- Target MAP ≥ 65 mmHg. Use lactic acid, mentation, and urine output as guides to adequate perfusion
- **1st Line NE, 2nd Line Vasopressin, 3rd Line Epi, 4th Line Ang II/Dopamine**
  - SOAP II Trial: NE > Dopamine (less arrhythmias)
- **Other options:**
  - **Phenylephrine** - May be useful in tachyarrhythmias to slow HR. Also comes in the code cart which makes this a good option if other pressors aren't immediately available
  - **Ang II** - Contraindicated in patients with CHF, VTE/hypercoagulable, thrombocytopenia <50k, severe bronchospasm
    - Needs approval from MICU director for order
  - **Low CO:** Dobutamine + NE OR Epi single agent
- Need ulcer prophylaxis w/ PPI or H2 blocker (preferably PO if possible)

#### Steroids: Persistent septic shock w/ ongoing pressor requirements, consider IV corticosteroids (particularly beneficial in ARDS, severe CAP)
- Hydrocortisone 100 mg q8 or 50 mg q6 IV +/- fludrocortisone 50 µg (if concerned for adrenal insufficiency) enteral daily for 7 d or until out of shock

#### Additional management:
- **NaHCO3** – may be useful if pH ≤ 7.1
- Early enteral nutrition (within 72 hours) if possible, would start at a trickle / trophic rate

**AVOID beta-blockers** unless you think HR compromising cardiac output by limiting diastolic filling/lack of atrial kick in afib; this is a physiologic compensatory response

## Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)

**Author: Jessica Reed**

### Background

ARDS is a form of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema characterized by acute onset (<7 days), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and severe hypoxemia as a result of diffuse systemic inflammation which damages the alveoli/capillary endothelium interface causing fluid and protein accumulation within the interstitium and alveoli leading to impaired gas exchange, decreased lung compliance, and pulmonary hypertension

### Diagnostic Criteria, The Berlin Definition:

1. **Timing:** Onset within one week of a known clinical insult or new/worsening respiratory symptoms
2. **Chest Imaging:** Bilateral opacities on CXR/CT and/or consolidations on US. Not fully explained by effusions, atelectasis, or nodules/masses
3. **Origin of Edema:** Respiratory failure not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload
4. **Oxygenation:** Diagnosis defined with PaO2:FiO2 ≤ 300 or SpO2:FiO2 ≤ 315 with respiratory support of PEEP ≥5 or HFNC ≥ 30L. Severity based on PaO2/FiO2 ratio with PEEP or CPAP ≥ 5cm H2O (see below)

### Triggers of ARDS

| Direct | Indirect |
|--------|----------|
| - Pneumonia (viral and bacterial)<br>- Aspiration<br>- Lung contusion d/t trauma<br>- Direct inhalation injury<br>- Primary Graft dysfunction of transplant | - Non-pulmonary Sepsis (most common cause)<br>- Massive Blood Transfusion/TRALI<br>- Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation<br>- Drugs (Opioids, TCAs, ASA, cocaine, amiodarone, chemotherapy, salicylates)<br>- Pancreatitis<br>- Burns<br>- Radiation |

### Evaluation:

#### Severity:
Based on PaO2/FiO2 ratio ("the P to F ratio") with PEEP ≥ 5 cm H2O (as above)
- **PaO2** - arterial pressure of O2 (Obtained by ABG)
- **FiO2** - Fraction of inspired oxygen (expressed as a decimal between 0.21 and 1.0)

| Severity | PaO2/FiO2 ratio | SpO2/FiO2 (if SpO2 ≤ 97%) | PEEP or HFNC (Optiflow) |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Mild** | 300-201 | 246-315 | ≥5 or ≥30L |
| **Moderate** | 200-101 | 149-245 | ≥5 or ≥30L |
| **Severe** | <100 | <148 | ≥5 or ≥30L |

### Management:

**Frequently requires intubation as non-invasive ventilation is not often effective.**

#### Interventions with proven mortality benefit:

**Low tidal volume (Vt) ventilation (LTVV):**
- Goal Vt is 4-8 mL/kg of ideal body weight
- Target plateau pressure of ≤ 30 cm H2O
- Oxygenation goal: PaO2 55-80 mmHg or SpO2 88-95%
- Slowly titrate PEEP and FiO2 concurrently to achieve oxygenation goals
- pH goal: ≥ 7.20; "permissive hypercapnia"; titrate respiratory rate to target as normal pH as possible
- Treat ventilator dyssynchrony

**Proning:**
- Can be considered if moderate to severe ARDS and oxygenation does not improve with LTVV
- PROSEVA study (2013) demonstrated mortality benefit to early and prolonged proning (16 hours per day) in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (most significant benefit for severe)

#### Interventions that probably won't hurt the patient but less data to support them:
- **Conservative fluid management** and IV diuresis as needed (at risk for pulmonary edema d/t vascular leak); goal of net even or negative.
  - Note: FACTT study demonstrated 2 more days alive and off the ventilator with aggressive diuresis, but no mortality difference
- **Glucocorticoids** in ARDS d/t septic shock, COVID, CAP, steroid-responsive conditions; may shorten time on ventilator but may also result in some neuromuscular weakness

**American Thoracic Society Guidelines of 2024** placed emphasis on early ECMO involvement and neuromuscular blockade in severe ARDS patients. Two trials on neuromuscular blockade (ACURASYS and ROSE) with conflicting results. EOLIA suggest benefit to ECMO in patients with P/F <80 or hypercapnic respiratory acidosis.

## Intubation and Extubation

**Author: Jacob Lee**

### Intubation

This section will discuss how an ideal intubation will work; intubations during codes are emergent scenarios where this process will differ

#### Indications:
- **Respiratory failure** – hypoxic and/or hypercapnic; NOTE hypercapnia with a normal pH is not a reason to intubate, this is well compensated
- **Respiratory distress** – angioedema or anaphylaxis with impending airway compromise, significantly increased work of breathing and pending ventilatory failure due to exhaustion
- **Airway protection** – altered mental status without ability protect airway (prevent aspiration and clear secretions); GCS <8 -> intubate
  - Although recent study (NICO trial in JAMA) suggests that not intubating patients with acute overdose and GCS<8 is better (fewer complications, shorter ICU and hospital LOS) than intubation
- **Airway trauma** – damage or penetrating injuries to larynx

#### Contraindications:
- Airway trauma/obstruction preventing safe placement of ETT; if definitive airway is needed in these cases, consider tracheostomy/cricothyrotomy
- Not within goals of care. Confirm code status with patient, family, or surrogate

#### Considerations:
- Will the patient be able to be extubated? Is the underlying cause necessitating intubation treatable/reversible (severe, progressive neuromuscular disease)? Would a tracheostomy be within their goals of care?
- Is the intubation high risk? Difficult airway anatomy, physiologic instability, underlying comorbidities (pulmonary hypertension) increase the chance further decompensation with intubation

**If overnight, Airway team must be called. See the following "Anesthesia Airway" section chapter**

### Checklist

**Assess the patient:**
- **Airway predictors for difficult intubation:** Mallampati ≥ III, neck circumference > 40 cm, thyromental distance < 6cm, head-neck extension <30°, mouth unable to open > 34cm
- **High risk comorbidities:** pulmonary hypertension with RV failure, angioedema, variceal hemorrhage, hemodynamic instability

**Prepare the patient:**
- Two large bore IVs
- Position in the supine sniffing position, pre-oxygenate with 100% FiO2 and NIV if patient not actively vomiting
- Optimize medical status: Give appropriate resuscitation, temporize anemia (hgb >7) /electrolyte abnormalities (hyperkalemia)

**Prepare the equipment:**
- **Monitoring:** SpO2, end-tidal CO2 monitor (capnography), continuous BP cycling, telemetry
- **Airway:** Bag-valve mask, 2 endotracheal tubes (check cuffs prior to utilization), direct laryngoscope, video laryngoscope, bougie/stylet, suction device (on and functional), supraglottic and oropharyngeal airway as backup

**Prepare the medications:**
- Paralytic (succinylcholine or rocuronium), sedative - induction (etomidate or ketamine) and maintenance (propofol), analgesic for intubation (fentanyl)
- Should have fluids, pressors, inotropes hanging in the room. Push-dose pressors (Neostick's=syringe of phenylephrine) also valuable

**NOTE:** we are currently doing a clinical trial on sedatives and paralytics to see if there is a superior regimen

**Paralytic Agents:**
- **Succinylcholine** – depolarizing agent, faster onset (45-60 seconds), shorter duration (5-10 minutes) but should be avoided in hyperkalemia, burns, crush injuries, and neuromuscular disease (PD, MG, ALS)
- **Rocuronium** – non-depolarizing agent, longer onset (45-90 seconds) longer duration (30-60 minutes) safer in CKD patients, as well as in NMD patients. Note, longer duration of action may outlast the duration of the induction sedative - risk for paralysis awareness

**Induction sedatives:**
- **Etomidate** – hemodynamically stable to slight hypotension
- **Ketamine** – hemodynamically stable, can be dually helpful for bronchospasm
- **Propofol** – associated with hypotension

**Prepare the team:**
- First and second intubators, RT, RN to prepare meds, RN to give meds, someone to monitor hemodynamics, someone with hand on the pulse
- Run through the plan: meds to be given, meds available as backup

### Rapid-sequence intubation (RSI):
- Simultaneous administration of a sedative and paralytic to reduce patient movement and airway reflexes and quickly achieve optimal intubation conditions
- Goal is to intubate within 60 seconds of paralysis onset
- Preferred method of induction; associated with increased first-attempt success, reduced aspiration risk, reduced gastric insufflation, and even improved extubation rates

### Post-intubation:
- Ensure correct ETT placement: End-tidal CO2 color change (gold standard), bilateral breath sounds, and chest rise, absence of gastric sounds, CXR
- Secure the ETT with tape and/or tube holder
- Ventilate patients according to condition

### Complications:
- **Airway trauma** (oropharyngeal, laryngeal/vocal cords)
- **Aspiration:** Suction airway (ideally prior to initiation of PPV). Mixed data re whether cricoid pressure during intubation (i.e. Selleck maneuver) decreases risk of this.
- **Desaturation/Hypoxia:** Caused by inadequate preoxygenation, PTX, mucous plugging. Rescue maneuvers with bag-mask ventilation if necessary. Stat CXR
- **Hypercapnia:** Assess for cuff leaks - if underinflated or defective can lead to poor ventilation
- **Cardiovascular collapse:** intubation increases intrathoracic pressure and thus decreases venous return and CO; sedation vasodilates and decreases BP, sympathetic surge may trigger arrhythmia leading to cardiogenic shock. Manage with fluids/pressors if need, rule out other causes (ex: hypoxia, PTX)
- **Mechanical injury:** Dental, soft tissue, tracheal, laryngeal. Retrieve any dislodged teeth, suction blood

## Anesthesia Airway

**Editors:** Mercede Erickson, MD, Camille Adajar, MD  
**Faculty Editor:** Brandon Pruett, MD

**Call/text Airway Phone: (615) 887-7369**

- Provides direct contact with the on-call resident/Airway Team (we also respond to all overhead STATs for airway management)
- Utilized during MICU night shifts or when the MICU attending is unavailable
- If the Airway Team is consulted for intubation, the anesthesia attending and residents will perform the intubation sequence and intubation – other team members are not permitted to intubate under these circumstances per Anesthesiology Department protocol

---

## Extubation

Patients should be assessed for extubation readiness on a daily basis with SAT/SBT trials

### Spontaneous Awakening Trial (SAT)
- **Contraindication:** seizures, alcohol withdrawal, agitation, paralytics, MI, or increased ICP
- **Pass:** Patient is able to follow commands without significant anxiety, agitation, or respiratory distress as evidenced by vital signs. Precedex can be used if having trouble with agitation or anxiety
- **Fail:** Unable to cooperate/follow commands, clinically significant VS changes (new or worsening arrhythmia, tachypnea, hypoxia)
- If failed, restart sedation at reduced dose and titrate to RASS 0 (unless otherwise specified)

### Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT)
- Once SAT is passed
- Trial of pressure support (PS); PEEP ≤7.5cm H2O and FiO2 ≤ 50% for at least 30 minutes (ideal settings: PS 5cm H2O and PEEP 5cm H2O with FiO2 40%)
- **Pass:** No evidence of respiratory distress (tachypnea, bradypnea, hypoxia)
- **Fail:** Tachypnea (RR>35), bradypnea (RR <8), hypoxia (O2 sat < 88%), respiratory distress, cardiac arrhythmia, worsening hypotension; new hypertension (demonstrates increased work to maintain adequate breathing on SBT)

### Additional considerations prior to extubation:
- Has the underlying cause of their respiratory failure or need to be intubated improved?
- Is the patient able to protect their airway (coughing) and handle secretions?
- What does the patient need to be extubated to? (RA, LFNC, BiPAP)
  - Preventative post-extubation BiPAP not routinely used in all pts but consider in select populations at high risk for failure: severe COPD with preexisting chronic hypercarbia, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, NMD, baseline airway regimen
- Is there a cuff leak, or lack thereof which will require pretreatment with steroids?

### Cuff leak test:
Set ventilator to AC/VC and measure the TV. Deflate the ETT cuff completely, observe for an audible leak, and measure the difference in TV between delivered and exhaled breaths over 6 breathing cycles. Average the 3 lowest expiratory TV values

- **Positive cuff leak:** can hear audible leak, TV difference of >110-130 mL or > 10% between delivered and exhaled breath; significant variability in criteria
- **A negative cuff leak test (lack of cuff leak)** is not very accurate, but can indicate possible laryngeal edema and post-extubation airway obstruction/stridor
  - Negative cuff leak is not an absolute CI to extubation. Will likely require steroids to minimize airway swelling
  - IV Solumedrol 20 mg IV Q4hrs for 4 doses prior to extubation

**For borderline cases, calculate a Rapid Shallow Breathing Index (RSBI):**
- RR/TV (L) during their SBT or while on PS
- RSBI > 105 is indicative of higher likelihood of reintubation; higher score = greater risk

### Post-Extubation:
- Consider ABG/VBG 20-30 mins after extubation to ensure adequate ventilation
- Airway clearance therapy should be available for patients with NMD, COPD/bronchiectasis, and those with heavy secretion burdens
- Extubating to BiPAP as described above has data supporting its use in certain scenarios. Note, rescue BiPAP to prevent re-intubation has not been shown to be beneficial and only found to delay reintubation. Exception: patient has known hypercapnea - then rescue BIPAP may actually rescue patients from re-intubation

### Complications:

**Laryngeal Edema/Stridor:** Can occur even if positive cuff leak
- **Risk factors:** Prolonged intubation ≥7 days, large ETT, repeated or traumatic intubation attempts, tracheal stenosis or upper airway mass, history of angioedema or anaphylaxis, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, ARDS
- **Treatment:** 40 mg IV Solumedrol, inhaled racemic epinephrine and reassess in 60 minutes. If still present or patient has respiratory distress, consider re-intubation

**Post-extubation respiratory failure:** hypoxic or hypercapnic
- **Risk factors:** ARDS, PNA, Volume Overload, Sepsis
- Consider blood gas 20-30 minutes post-extubation. Unless select high risk population discussed above, rescue BiPAP not shown to prevent re-intubation. If showing signs of respiratory distress, consider re-intubation.

## Modes of Oxygen Delivery

**Author: Jacob Lee**

### Definitions:
**Entrainment** – the process of oxygen being mixed with ambient air that impacts the true fraction of inspired oxygen delivered to the patient

### Non-Invasive modes of oxygenation augmentation

These modes of oxygen delivery focus on oxygenation as opposed to ventilation

| System | L/min | % O2 | Comments |
|--------|-------|------|----------|
| **Blow by** (ex: Trach collar) | Depends on O2 delivery device | 21-100% | Used for patients who cannot tolerate more direct devices (agitated, cuffed tracheostomy tubes); how snug the trach collar is determines the degree of entrainment |
| **Nasal cannula** | 1-6 | 24 – 45% | Add 3-4% to Room Air FiO2 (21%) for each liter of supplemental oxygen administered. Flows in excess of 6 L/min will not appreciably increase the FiO2 |
| **Large bore nasal cannula** | Up to 15 | Up to 80% | This is NOT high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) although it may be documented in the chart as such. The nasal cannula prongs have a larger radius allowing for additional flow that will reliably increase flow rate up to 15 L/min |
| **Venturi mask** | 2 to 15 | Up to 60% | Color-coded adaptors allow for specific entrainment that deliver more accurate FiO2 delivery at given flows. Actual FiO2 is dependent on pt effort |
| **Non-rebreather** | 10 to 15 | 60-90% | Reservoir bag is filled with pure oxygen, with one-way valves that prevent patient from breathing ambient air. Often used as a bridge to a higher tier of oxygen delivery |
| **HFNC:** Optiflow, AirVo, Vapotherm | 50-60 | 30-100% | Used for hypoxic respiratory failure; although does deliver roughly 0.6-1.2 cm/H2O of PEEP per 10L of flow, not typically used for hypercapnic respiratory failure |

### Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation

- Deliver set pressures by adjusting flow. Note, while flow and pressure are inter-related, they cannot be inter-converted. Pressure is maintained by regulating flow dynamically based on patient effort and lung mechanics
- Supplemental flow and FiO2 can be delivered into the tubing or blended into the machine (bled in) to give FiO2 reliably up to 60% (outpatient with oxygen bled in) or close to 100% (inpatient using high-flow devices)

| System | Settings | Indications | Comments |
|--------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **CPAP** | Pressure (CPAP), FiO2 | OSA, Tracheomalacia | FiO2 delivery varies due to leaks, mask type, and patient breathing pattern. Not indicated solely for oxygen delivery but can bleed oxygen in if hypoxia is also present |
| **BiPAP** | IPAP, EPAP (nomenclature is IPAP/EPAP), FiO2, RR | Hypoxic and/or hypercapnic respiratory failure, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, prevention of post-extubation respiratory failure in high-risk patients | Delta between IPAP and EPAP = driving pressure (higher driving pressure improves ventilation not oxygenation). Increasing EPAP can improve oxygenation by increased mean airway pressure but will not improve ventilation. FiO2 delivery varies due to pressure cycling, leaks, and inspiratory flow changes. Generally contraindicated if patient unable to remove mask themself, vomiting, or lots of secretions |

***All of the above oxygen delivery systems are used in spontaneously breathing patients***

### Invasive positive-pressure ventilation
- See "Intubation and Extubation" chapter (chapter prior to this one) for indications
- See "Introduction to Ventilator Management" below for ventilator modes

## Introduction to Vent Management

**Author: Seth Alexander**

See "Intubation and Extubation" for the clinical criteria to initiate or discontinue mechanical ventilation.

### Ventilator Settings:

**Trigger:** what initiates a breath; time, flow, or pressure
- Patient-initiated triggers are flow and pressure
- Ventilator breaths are triggered by time

**Cycle:** what terminates a breath

| Mode | You set | Not set | Comments |
|------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Pressure support (PS)** | PEEP<br>PS above PEEP<br>FiO2 | TV<br>RR<br>Inspiratory flow | - Used for spontaneous breathing trials (see intubation and extubation) and vent weaning<br>- Patient is breathing on their own and will trigger each breath, setting their own flow, RR and TV<br>- PS added to overcome the inherent resistance of the circuit |
| **Volume Control (AC/VC)** | PEEP<br>RR<br>TV<br>Inspiratory flow<br>FiO2 | Inspiratory pressure | - Patient or ventilator can trigger a breath; the breath is initiated when a preset tidal volume is delivered<br>- Pros: Guarantees a minute ventilation and low tidal volume; will limit volutrauma<br>- Cons: Pressure varies and may lead to lower mean airway pressure and thus less alveolar recruitment; if lungs become less compliant, the pressure needed to deliver set tidal volumes can become dangerously high causing risk of barotrauma |
| **SIMV<br>Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation** | PEEP<br>RR<br>FiO2<br>If vent triggered breaths, TV<br>If pt triggered breaths, PS above PEEP | | - Vent provides a set number of breaths at a set tidal volume. Patient can trigger breaths above this rate that are only supported by designated PS/PEEP (no set TV)<br>- The ventilator tries to synchronize with the patient's breathing effort<br>Pros: more comfortable, allows for spontaneous breathing<br>Cons: Increased work of breathing if patient is tachypneic but not getting adequate TV with spont breaths, breath stacking if async w vent, does not guarantee MV<br>- Numerous RCTs demonstrated that it's worse for vent weaning – associated with longer weans and fewer liberations |
| **Pressure Control (AC/PC)** | RR<br>Inspiratory Pressure<br>PEEP<br>Inspiratory Time (or I:E ratio)<br>FiO2 | TV | - Patient or ventilator can trigger breaths. All breaths supported. The breath is cycled when the preset inspiratory time is reached<br>- The ventilator maintains a constant pressure during inspiration (flow decreases as the lungs fill with air)<br>Pros: theoretically better for oxygenation - maintains a more consistent mean airway pressure, limits barotrauma<br>Cons: Tidal volume, and therefore, MV is not guaranteed, requires close monitoring as TV and MV may drop if lung compliance decreases (need to increase low MV alarm threshold manually) |
| **PRVC<br>Pressure Regulated Volume Control** | PEEP<br>RR<br>TV<br>Inspiratory flow<br>Pressure max<br>FiO2 | | - Attempts to reach a set volume by adjusting the pressure (same triggers and cycles as AC/VC)<br>- Vent will average the preceding few breaths to try and deliver a desired tidal volume at the lowest possible pressure<br>Pros: Tries to limit both volutrauma and barotrauma<br>Cons: If conflict between the VC and PC aspects (e.g. ARDS), PC will supersede - cannot guarantee MV. The more work the patient does, the less the ventilator does and patients may be prone to 'tiring out' – should monitor PCO2 with blood gases |
| **APRV / Bilevel** | PEEP (PLow)<br>Pressure High<br>Time Low<br>Time High<br>FiO2 | TV | - The ventilator cycles between P(high) and P(low) based on preset times but the patient is allowed to breathe spontaneously at any time<br>- Usually, long periods of inspiratory holds with brief expirations<br>- Pros: Used for refractory hypoxemia - increases mean airway pressure and alveolar recruitment<br>- Cons: Does not guarantee MV, risk of air trapping and hyperinflation due to auto-PEEP and breath-stacking, often difficult to ventilate patients |

### Static Ventilator Readouts:
- **Plateau pressure (Pplat):** Measured with an inspiratory hold (assesses lung compliance)
- **Auto-PEEP:** Measured with an expiratory hold; occurs when volume of previous breath is not entirely expelled before the next breath is initiated

### Dynamic Ventilator Readouts:
- **Measured RR:** In most modes, patients may trigger breaths more frequently than the set RR; if set and measured RR match, consider ↓ respiratory drive (sedation, neurologic injury) or iatrogenic over-ventilation
- **Tidal volume of inspiration (VTi) and expiration (VTe)**
  - VTi should approximately equal VTe. If not, then assess for an air leak (e.g. cuff leak or pneumothorax) or auto-PEEP
- **Minute ventilation:** calculated from VTe x RR; higher MV = more CO2 clearance
- **Peak (Inspiratory) pressure (PIP):** Highest pressure reached in the entire ventilator cycle

### Critical non-ventilator hemodynamic readouts:
- **SpO2:** If poor waveform or discordant with measured PaO2, exchange the probe or consider serial ABGs
- **HR:** Can be an indicator of emergencies such as pneumothorax, PE, ventilator disconnection
- **Blood pressure:** Positive pressure ventilation decreases preload and has mixed effects on afterload (pulmonary vascular resistance vs. systemic afterload) by altering intrathoracic pressure gradients.
  - Depending on the patient's pathophysiology, increases in positive pressure may be detrimental or beneficial for BP

**It is helpful, when you first have a ventilated patient, to review the equipment that makes up the "circuit" from the ventilator to the patient and back with an RT or bedside nurse.**
- Key things to know: How to inline suction, perform an inspiratory hold, reconnect/disconnect the circuit to the ETT if needing to bag the patient, etc.

### Troubleshooting vent alarms:

| Alarm Type | What is causing the alarm? | Troubleshooting |
|------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| **High Peak Pressure** | Dynamic compliance issue (resistance of the circuit when there is air flowing) vs. Static compliance issue (stretch of the lung - doesn't change with airflow) | **Step 1:** Check plateau pressure by performing inspiratory hold. Must be in VC mode.<br><br>**High Peak and Low Plateau:** Dynamic compliance issue → High Resistance<br>Work outside -> in:<br>- Check if pt is biting on the ETT<br>- Incline suction to clear secretions or proximal mucous plug<br>- Check circuit tubing for excess water condensation, mucous plug, or a kink. Ask RT to disconnect and clear circuit<br>- Auscultate for wheezing/stridor to indicate bronchospasm or obstruction → give bronchodilators<br><br>**High Peak and High Plateau:** Static compliance issue → Worsening alveolar process<br>Emergencies: tension PTX, mainstem intubation<br>Work Outside -> in:<br>- Obesity/chest wall rigidity<br>- Abdominal Compartment syndrome/ascites<br>- Single Lung: mucous plug, large pleural effusion/atelectasis<br>- Worsening alveolar process - pulmonary edema, PNA, DAH, ARDS<br>  - CXR, b-lines on US, tracheal aspirate, bronchoscopy, etc. |
| **Low Tidal Volume/Low Minute Ventilation (VE)** | Patient is not getting the desired (set) tidal volume/VE. The alarm reports exhaled VE. This may cause inadequate ventilation, CO2 retention, and potentially hypoxia. | 1. Put patient back on VC, assess for high peak pressures (-> low volume in certain vent modes)<br>2. Compare inspiratory tidal volumes (Vti) with expiratory tidal volumes (Vte) on the ventilator.<br><br>**If Vti>Vte, check for a leak in the system:**<br>- Check circuit for connection leaks w RT<br>- Listen for a cuff leak – can have RT check a cuff pressure and if low re-inflate → sometimes need to do an ETT exchange<br>- Ensure ETT not high or out<br><br>3. Consider disconnecting vent and bagging pt<br>**If normal resistance:**<br>- Leak in ventilator, tubing, or Y-adapter<br>**If low resistance:**<br>- Cuff leak, ETT above cords, or bronchopleural fistula<br><br>**If low tidal volumes and no leak (ie. Vti = Vte) and RR WNL:**<br>- Patient may need more support (i.e. switching to a different vent mode (PS to PRVC)). Discuss with RT or fellow<br><br>**If low RR and no leak and Vt at goal:**<br>- Patient may be over-sedated<br>- May need to increase set/back-up ventilator respiratory rate |
| **Apnea** | No breaths are being triggered by the vent… in other words, your pt is NOT breathing → this is an emergency… | ***Check that the patient hasn't self-extubated, their trach hasn't fallen out, or they haven't been unhooked from vent***<br><br>If self-extubated or tracheostomy decannulated, then immediately start bagging the pt (may need to bag from trach stoma if s/p laryngectomy)<br>Have nurse call staff assist for re-intubation if necessary or have trach team called to replace a fresh (<7 days old) trach |

## Refractory Hypoxemia

**Author: Hannah Kieffer**

### Background
- Inadequate arterial oxygenation despite high levels of inspired O2 or the development of barotrauma in mechanically ventilated pts
  - Oxygen index (MAP × FiO2 × 100/PaO2) < 40
- Consider work up/interventions below if needing FiO2 >80%

### Differential:
- Always first consider worsening of primary underlying process
- Consider recent injuries/interventions, e.g., smoke inhalation, opioid administration and check dose, recent blood transfusion, etc.
- **Altered alveolar permeability/V-Q mismatch:**
  - PE, pneumothorax, fluid overload (severe pleural effusion/pulmonary edema), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), new ARDS, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
- **Shunting:**
  - Large lung consolidation, bronchus obstruction, intracardiac shunt, intrapulmonary shunt (pulmonary AVMs)

### Evaluation:
- Always get CXR STAT if pt has new or worsening O2 requirement
  - Consider CT chest if patient stable enough
- CBC, ABG
- **POCUS:**
  - Lack of lung sliding; pneumothorax
  - RV enlargement/septal bowing/McConnell's sign; RV strain in PE
- TTE if stable and concerned for intracardiac shunt/acute HF decompensation
- Bronchoscopy if concerned for mucous plug

### Management Algorithm for refractory hypoxemia

**Initial triaging maneuvers:**
- If at any point the pt is rapidly decompensating, you can always disconnect them from the vent and bag them until they recover/while calling for help
- Troubleshoot ventilator – see "Introduction to Vent Management" for more information
- Optimize fluid status; consider diuresis/dialysis if not making significant urine
- Reposition patient – elevated HOB, position "good lung" down

**Consider higher PEEP strategy:**
- Increased PEEP -> higher mean airway pressure. Generally, improves oxygenation especially with diffuse pulmonary pathologies
  - Exceptions may include certain focal/shunt pathologies (e.g. dense lobar PNA)
  - Worsening oxygenation may occur with overdistension of alveoli -> increased dead space ventilation; generally determined empirically at the bedside
- Titrate up slowly; generally, do not exceed PEEP 18
  - Limited by high plateau pressures/barotrauma, overdistension/dead space ventilation, decreased preload/venous return
- **ARDS net FiO2/PEEP Tables:** At VUMC we typically use the Lower PEEP table
  - Note - Updated 2024 guidelines conditionally recommend use of higher PEEP (reduced mortality and fewer ventilator days) without prolonged lung recruitment maneuvers (higher mortality)

#### Lower PEEP/higher FiO2

| FiO2 | 0.3 | 0.4 | 0.4 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.6 | 0.7 | 0.7 |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| PEEP | 5 | 5 | 8 | 8 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 12 |

| FiO2 | 0.7 | 0.8 | 0.9 | 0.9 | 0.9 | 1.0 |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| PEEP | 14 | 14 | 14 | 16 | 18 | 18-24 |

#### Higher PEEP/lower FiO2

| FiO2 | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.4 | 0.4 | 0.5 |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| PEEP | 5 | 8 | 10 | 12 | 14 | 14 | 16 | 16 |

| FiO2 | 0.5 | 0.5-0.8 | 0.8 | 0.9 | 1.0 | 1.0 |
|------|-----|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| PEEP | 18 | 20 | 22 | 22 | 22 | 24 |

**Inhaled vasodilators:** Distribute preferentially to well-ventilated alveoli ->local vasodilation -> improved V/Q matching
- VUMC formulary preference: Inhaled epoprostenol (aka Flolan)
- Alternatives: Inhaled milrinone, inhaled nitric oxide
- Data suggest they improve PaO2/FiO2; large RCT without evidence for mortality benefit

**Deep sedation (RASS -4 or -5)**
- Promotes ventilator synchrony

**Neuromuscular blockade (paralysis)** – call your fellow before doing this
- Maximal vent synchrony (eliminates residual chest wall/diaphragm tone)
- Pt MUST be RASS -5 (need analgesia + sedation)
- Trial one time IV push of vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg
- If improved vent synchrony/oxygenation, consider cisatracurium (Nimbex) drip
- Data are mixed; ACURASYS 2010 (improved 90-day mortality but underpowered likely overestimating benefit); ROSE 2019 (no difference in 90-day mortality)

**Prone positioning (Need attending approval)**
- Pts with moderate to severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 150)
- At VUMC, we use regular ICU beds and manually flip pts; cycle prone 16h/supine 8h
- When proning or supining a pt, always have a provider who can intubate in the room in case unplanned extubation occurs
- Considerations: need a team of people to reposition, high risk of ET tube malposition, difficult to access lines/perform procedures, high risk of pressure injuries
- Data: PROSEVA 2013 - proning improved 28-day mortality; note study c/b imbalances between groups

**Alternative ventilator modes (usually PC or APRV/BiLevel/BiVent)**
- APRV/BiVent should be avoided in people with bad obstructive lung dx, hemodynamic instability, refractory hypercarbia
- No data that demonstrates superiority of any one ventilator mode over another

**Venovenous (V-V) ECMO**
- CONSULT EARLY if a pt may be a candidate; allows ECMO team to assist with evaluation
- **Hypoxemia related indications:**
  - PaO2/FiO2 < 50 with FiO2 >80% for >3h OR
  - PaO2/FiO2 < 80 with FiO2 >80% for >6h
  - PaO2 <40 mmHg despite maximal ventilator support
  - Murray Score ≥ 3
- **Absolute Contraindications:**
  - Poor short-term prognosis/non-survival comorbidity (e.g. metastatic cancer)
  - Irreversible, devastating neurologic pathology
  - Irreparable cardiac damage and unsuitable for transplant/VAD
  - Chronic respiratory insufficiency without the possibility for transplant
  - Limitation of care orders (DNR)
- Can calculate RESP score; predicts in-hospital survival with ECMO
- **Data:**
  - Included in updated 2024 ATS practice guidelines
  - CESAR 2009: Improved 6-month survival without severe disability
  - EOLIA 2018: No mortality benefit but 28% crossover from control to ECMO arm dilutes potential effects. ECMO group had a significant increase in ventilator-free days

## Refractory Hypercapnia

**Author: Hannah Kieffer**

### Background:
- **Definition:** Inadequate clearance of CO2 leading to respiratory acidosis (pH ≤ 7.20) despite maximum RR&TV (i.e. minute ventilation) tolerated without causing barotrauma or autoPEEP
- **Common causes:**
  - Obstructive lung disease (COPD, emphysema, asthma)
  - Hypoventilation syndromes (congenital central hypoventilation, brainstem injury, sleep apnea, obesity, sedative medications (i.e. opiates), neuromuscular weakness, chest wall trauma, ascites/pleural effusion)
  - Increased CO2 load (shock, sepsis, malignant hyperthermia)
- **Presentation:**
  - Shortness of breath, AMS, somnolence, hypoxemia, tachycardia, HTN (in some cases)

### Evaluation:
- Physical exam, mental status, recent medications
- ABG or VBG
  - Respiratory acidosis: Expect high CO2; normal pH suggests chronic condition with compensation vs low pH suggests more acuity
  - If increased PCO2 and normal pH, always treat the pH and not the PCO2 (i.e., if compensated chronic hypercarbia, decreasing CO2 below what the patient has adapted to -> decreased respiratory drive, cerebral vasoconstriction, Bohr effect)

### Management Algorithm:

**Maximize conventional ventilation strategies:**
- Consider HFNC or BiPAP if safe
- If refractory (PaCO2 >60 mmHg for >6 hours w pH <7.25), consider ECCO2R
- Consider escalation to V-V ECMO

**Special considerations:**
- If history of OSA, make sure they are on home CPAP/BiPAP
- If opiate related, trial Narcan
- If reactive airway disease contributing, bronchodilators

**BiPAP:**
- Contraindicated if pt unable to remove BiPAP mask independently
- Increase MV by increasing Δ between IPAP/EPAP or increasing RR

**Mechanical ventilation:**
- Allows you to control rate and TV (in VC modes)
- **To increase MV and CO2 clearance:**
  - **Increase RR:**
    - Up to ~30-35 breaths/min
    - Need to keep in mind I/E time to avoid breath stacking/autoPEEP
    - Evidence of autoPEEP: Increased WOB/vent dyssynchrony, worsening hypotension, and failure of the expiratory limb on the flow waveform on the vent to return to zero
    - Possible corrective measures: Lower RR, decrease inspiratory time, increase expiratory phase time
  - **Increase TV:**
    - Usually start at 4-6mL/kg PBW. Can consider increasing to 8mL/kg PBW as long as plateau pressures remain < 30 cm H2O
    - Goal peak pressures ≤ 35 cmH2O / plateau pressures ≤ 30 cmH2O
    - If ARDS, allow for permissive hypercapnia (goal pH ≥ 7.2)

**V-V ECMO / Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R):**
- **Indications for ECMO for hypercapnia:**
  - Severe dynamic hyperinflation and/or severe respiratory acidosis
  - pH ≤ 7.20 with PaCO2 ≥ 60 for 6h with RR at 35/min and TV increased to target maximum MV while keeping plateau pressure ≤ 32 cmH2O
- Similar considerations and contraindications as refractory hypoxemia (see above)
  - Benefits: Reduces work of breathing, promotes early ventilator weaning/extubating -> allows early mobilization and recovery

## Tracheostomy

**Author: Alice Kennedy**

### Indications for Tracheostomy:
- Prolonged mechanical intubation and weaning (typically consider ~ day 14)
- Prior failed extubation attempt(s)
- Tracheal stenosis
- Upper airway obstructions (e.g., head and neck cancers, severe infections, congenital obstructions)
- Trauma
- Neuromuscular disease

### Benefits of Tracheostomy vs ET tube:
- Lower risk of laryngeal and vocal cord damage
- Improved ability to communicate (i.e. speaking valve)
- Improved pt comfort and decreased need for sedation
- Lower airway resistance -> reduced work of breathing
  - May reduce time to wean from the vent and hospital LOS (mixed data)
- Potential improvement in patient mobility
- Easier access to trachea for suctioning/airway hygiene
- May decrease risk of ventilator associated pneumonia (Mixed data)

**Note:** No proven reduction in short-term mortality

### Timing of Tracheostomy:
- Generally performed after 2 weeks of intubation (timing not backed by data)
- Pts that might get tracheostomy earlier: Anticipated prolonged mechanical ventilation (i.e. those with acute neurologic injury affecting spinal cord)
- Research: No benefit in 30-day mortality rates or hospital length of stay for early (day 4) vs late (day 10) tracheostomy in TracMan trial (Tracheostomy Management trial, 2013)
  - *NOTE: Many patients in late trach group did not end up requiring one

### Tracheostomy Tubes:
- Most common in hospital = Portex (Previously Shiley)
- **Components:**
  - **Faceplate/Flange:** Keeps tube in place, has the model and size on it
  - **Inner cannula:** Can be removed, cleaned, and replaced in case of obstruction
  - **Cuff (may or may not have):** Allows for pt to be ventilated; may prevent some aspiration. Pressure needs to be assessed qshift and kept <30mmHg
  - **Fenestration (i.e. holes in the cannula) (may or may not have):** Allow speaking without valve
  - **Obturator/Trocar:** Kept at the bedside to assist with trach insertion/removal
- **Common sizes:**
  - Initial: 8-0; Standard downsizing: 6-0 (Sizing: Comparable to ETT size for Portex)
  - Lengths: Standard vs. larger XLT (P = longer proximal end, D = longer distal end)
- **Presenting on ICU rounds** = size/cuff status/brand (e.g. 8-0 cuffed Portex)
- **"Trach collar"** means pt is receiving just humidified O2/room air, cuff should be down

### Speaking Valves:
- **Passy Muir Valve (PMV):** One-way valve placed on the outer portion of the trach; air moves in with inspiration but is blocked and thus funneled up around/outside the trach and through the vocal cords during exhalation allowing for phonation
- **Contraindications:** Severe upper airway obstruction or aspiration risk, copious secretions, decreased cognitive status, severe medical instability, or inability to tolerate cuff deflation
- **IMPORTANT SAFETY PRINCIPLE:** Cuff must be deflated when PMV is on. Since air needs to be able to travel back up the airway, if the cuff is not deflated and you put the PMV on then pt cannot exhale. Must remove when asleep.

### Maintenance of Tracheostomy Tubes:
- Inner cannula should be cleaned 2-3 times per day or swapped (disposable)
- Daily stoma care to prevent pressure ulcers and stoma infections
- As needed suctioning for secretions

### Complications and airway emergencies in a tracheostomy pt:
- **Hemorrhage** (mild bleeding from surface vessels and granulation tissue is common, major bleeding is rare - think erosion into brachiocephalic [innominate] artery)
  - Causes for alarm: Drop in sats/Hgb, new tachycardia or hypotension, increasing PIP, new/worsening bleeding, or large clots
- **Airway damage** - subglottic or tracheal stenosis, tracheobronchitis
- **Fistulas** (tracheoarterial, tracheoesophageal)
- **Unintended tracheostomy tube dislodgement:**
  - All pts with trachs have a yellow sign above bed with date, type, size of trach as well as a replacement trach with obturator in the room
    - **Fresh trach (≤ 14 days):** do NOT replace due to risk of misplacement into the mediastinum and loss of airway; airway management from above
    - **Older trach:** can be replaced at bedside with obturator by trained staff
  - **In the case of an EMERGENCY:**
    - Bag mask (use hand/gauze to occlude stoma) or intubate from above (i.e. through the mouth); if complete laryngectomy then must use stoma
    - Contact Surgical Airway Emergency Team +/- Team that placed it

### Secretion Management:
- Respiratory hygiene ("pulmonary toilet"): heated vent, guaifenesin (may not have an effect), hypertonic saline, DuoNebs, cough assist device, appropriate suctioning (too much -> worsens secretions), acapella, IS

### Decannulation:
- **Candidates:** Need to protect their airway and be on minimal FiO2 settings
  - Should pass capping trials and tolerate PMV for most of the day
- Avoid if imminently discharging/planning for procedures

## ABCDEF (A2F) Bundle

**Author: Kaele Leonard**

### Background
- **Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS):** complex constellation of cognitive, physical, and psychological impairments that impact most survivors of critical illness, leading to disability, frailty, and poor quality of life
  - Predicted by (1) duration of immobility and (2) delirium
  - Both are reduced by >80% compliance with ABCDEF (A2F) Bundle concepts
- **ABCDEF (A2F) Bundle:** Interprofessional, evidence-based safety bundle of care principles to help reduce LOS, mortality, bounce-backs, and the duration of ICU delirium and coma
- **Goal:** allow pt to "prove us wrong" about readiness for liberation from devices, sedatives, etc.

### Assess, prevent, and manage pain
- Tools to assess pain using facial expressions, body movements, muscle tension, compliance with ventilator, or vocalization for extubated pts
  - Ex: Critical Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT): scale 0-8, uncontrolled pain >=3
- Uncontrolled pain increases risk for delirium, limits inspiratory effort & weaning from ventilator, and limits ability to mobilize
- **Treatment:** multi-modal: parenteral opioids, neuropathic meds (e.g., gabapentin, ketamine), adjunctive non-opioids analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen, NSAIDs), nonpharmacologic interventions (repositioning, heat/cold)

### Both spontaneous awakening trials (SATs) and spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs)

**SATs = daily sedative interruptions**
- RN-driven protocol involving safety checklist: no active seizures, alcohol withdrawal, agitation, paralytics, myocardial infarction, or increased ICP
- If pass SAT, proceed to SBT
- If fail SAT (anxiety, agitation, pain, resp distress) → restart sedation at ½ doses

**SBTs = PS ventilation (Fi02 ≤ 50%, PEEP ≤ 7.5; typically 40% and 5/5) for ≥ 30 minutes**
- RT or physician/APP-driven protocol with safety screen: passed SAT, O2 sat ≥ 88%, inspiratory efforts, no myocardial ischemia, no/low vasopressor support
- If pass SBT, physician/APP judgment on extubation
- If fail SBT (RR > 35 or < 8, O2 sat < 88%, resp distress, mental status change) → restart full ventilatory support

**Evidence:**
- Liberated pts from mechanical ventilation 3 days sooner, decreased ICU and hospital length of stay by 4 days, and 14% absolute reduction in mortality at 1 year

### Choice of analgesia and sedation
- **Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS):** sedation & level of arousal assessment tool
  - Target light sedation of RASS -1 to 0 with goal of (1) pt following commands without agitation and (2) limiting immobilization
  - Over-sedation: hold sedatives till target, then restart at ½ prior dose
- Analgosedation with focus on treating pain first and then adding sedation meds PRN
- **Sedatives:** dexmedetomidine (dex) or propofol >>> benzodiazepines (increased delirium risk)

### Delirium - assess, prevent, and manage
- **Screening for delirium:** q4h using CAM-ICU
  - Affects 60-80% of ventilated pts and associated with increased morbidity and mortality, longer ICU and hospital length of stay, long-term cognitive dysfunction
- Risk factors and treatment: see Delirium section in Psychiatry

### Early mobility and exercise
- Prolonged immobilization during critical illness leads to ICU-acquired weakness, associated with worse outcomes: ↑ mechanical ventilation, increased hosp length of stay, greater mortality, and greater disability
- Consult PT/OT to initiate rehab at the beginning of critical illness
  - Can be done safely in pts receiving advanced support

### Family engagement and empowerment
- Especially important when pts are unable to communicate themselves
- Incorporate family at the bedside and on rounds to learn pt preferences and values, engage in shared decision making, and address questions and concerns

## ICU Delirium

**Author: Phil Schmitt**

### Background
- **Delirium** is a DSM-V diagnosis based on acute-onset fluctuating attention and awareness, unlike the chronic changes seen in dementia. It is largely interchangeable with **Encephalopathy.**
- This becomes more difficult to assess when patients are sedated, intubated, etc. in the ICU
- Very well-studied at VUMC, more resources found at: https://www.icudelirium.org
- Associated with higher morbidity and mortality compared to those who do not experience delirium and duration of delirium also associated with higher morbidity and mortality.

### Evaluation
- Can present as either **hyperactive** (agitated, trying to leave bed, etc.) or **hypoactive** (somnolent, minimally interactive, etc.).
- Do neuro exam to rule out focal deficits. Basic ICU/coma neuro exam:

| Component | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| **Level of consciousness** | If not alert and oriented, test if they are redirectable/open eyes to loud voice |
| **CN II (also III)** | Pupillary light reflex - check pupillary size + rate of constriction, symmetry |
| **CN III/IV/VI** | Eye tracking to voice, roaming around room |
| **CN V/VII** | Corneal blink reflex - can use NS syringes to drop water into eyes |
| **CN VIII (also III + VI)** | Oculocephalic reflex - turn head left/right, eyes should compensate to fix in forward position |
| **CN IX/X** | Cough/Gag - Can test with tongue depressor. If intubated, can advance/retract OG tube for gag and endotracheal tube suction catheter for cough |
| **CN XI** | Difficult in delirious/intubated patients, can check for Shoulder shrugging with pain response |
| **CN XII** | Difficult in delirious/intubated patients, can monitor for Spontaneous tongue movements |
| **Extremities** | +Withdrawal to pain: Pt appears to voluntarily, non-stereotypically withdraw limbs to vigorous nailbed pressure, sternal rub, trapezius pinch<br>+Localization of pain: Pt will attempt to reach to side of painful stimulus<br>+Muscle Tone: relaxed at baseline, no abnormal flexion/extension IE posturing<br>+Presence of abnormal reflexes: Unilateral hyper-/hypoactive reflexes, rapid & transient stereotyped movements to noxious stimuli IE triple flexion, up-going Babinski, ankle clonus |

- For ICU Patients, consider sedation when doing neuro exam - propofol and other anesthesia dampens brainstem + peripheral reflexes
- Always remember patients can be encephalopathic and evolve another acute neurological syndrome. Follow up any odd/changing exam findings.
- Perform the CAM-ICU for scoring – ICU nurses perform this q4h as part of routine ICU care
- See RASS scoring table in ABCDEF Bundle Critical Care chapter.

### Differential Diagnosis for ICU Delirium

Most typically due to changes in environment, alterations in sleep cycle, reduced cognitive reserve from critical illness, dementia, neurodegeneration, etc.

Other differentials fit in a modified **VITAMINS PO** mnemonic:

| Category | Differential Diagnoses |
|----------|------------------------|
| **Vascular** | Ischemic stroke, CNS hemorrhage, arrhythmia, carotid stenosis |
| **Infectious** | +Any severe illness, UTI & PNA are most common<br>+Also consider meningitis/encephalitis |
| **Trauma** | Falls, TBI, etc. |
| **Autoimmune** | Autoimmune encephalitis, SLE, CNS vasculitis among others |
| **Metabolic** | +Constipation<br>+Hypo/hyperthyroidism, hypoglycemia, AKI, hypercalcemia, hyperammonemia (IE hepatic encephalopathy), severe hyponatremia, Uremia among many others<br>+Vitamin deficiencies - thiamine and B12 especially |
| **Ingestion** | +Illicits, Opiates, Benzos, barbiturates, anti-psychotics, anti-cholinergics, cefepime<br>+Withdrawal syndromes - EtOH/benzos/opioids especially, also SSRI's/daily psych meds |
| **Neoplasm** | Brain mets, primary CNS tumors, CA associated with paraneoplastic syndromes (SCLC, Multiple myeloma, ovarian teratoma, etc.) |
| **Seizure** | |
| **Pain** | Always important to consider, especially in geriatric pts |
| **Oxygenation** | Hypoxia |

### Management
- Initial toxic/metabolic/infectious workup can include: CBC, CMP, TSH, Folate, Vitamin B12, UA, blood cultures, CT Head w/o. Look through med list to see if there are any sedating medications that could be contributing and try to minimize as much as possible.
- Definitive treatment is addressing underlying etiology.
- **First-line symptomatic treatment** includes delirium precautions, such as keeping blinds open during daytime, limiting daytime naps, redirection when agitated, lights on during day, TV on during day, family at bedside (opposite of these at night). There is an order in Epic called Nursing: Delirium Care, which can be found as part of the Geriatric Delirium Care order set, that has all these precautions listed out.
- Although they do not provide mortality benefit in ICU delirium patients (and debatably worsen mortality), **antipsychotics** can be used if needed for more severe agitation IE pulling at lines, physical aggression. Start with one-time dose of zyprexa 2.5 mg or 5 mg, can escalate to 1 mg haldol if refractory. Check an EKG for QTc prolongation (>440ms) prior to giving.

## Brain Death

**Author: Anna Berry**

### Background
**Brain death** = complete and permanent loss of brain function. Defined by coma with loss of capacity for consciousness, brainstem reflexes, and the ability to breathe independently

### Checklist for Determination of Brain Death (American Academy of Neurology)

#### 1. Prerequisites (all must be checked)
- Coma, irreversible and cause known
- Neuroimaging explains coma – usually CT or MRI
- Absence of CNS depressing drugs
- No evidence of residual paralytics (electrical stimulation if paralytics used)
- Absence of severe acid-base, electrolyte, endocrine abnormality
- Normothermia or mild hypothermia (core temp >36°C)
- SBP ≥100 mmHg
- No spontaneous respirations

#### 2. Examination (all must be checked) – Attending MUST be present for brain death exam
See: Greer DM, Determination of Brain Death. NEJM. 2021;385;2554-61. doi: 0.1056/NEJMcp2025326

#### 3. Apnea testing (all must be checked) – Attending MUST be present
- Pt is hemodynamically stable
- Ventilator adjusted to provide normocarbia (PaCO2 35–45 mmHg)
- Preoxygenate with 100% FiO2 and PEEP of 5 cmH2O for >10 min to PaO2 >200 mmHg
- Provide oxygen via a suction catheter to the level of the carina at 6 L/min or attach T-piece with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at 10 cmH2O
- Disconnect ventilator
- Spontaneous respirations absent
- Arterial blood gas drawn at 8–10 minutes, pt reconnected to ventilator
  - PCO2 ≥60 mmHg, or 20 mmHg rise from normal baseline value; OR:
  - Apnea test aborted due to spontaneous respirations present, hemodynamic instability, or hypoxia

#### 4. Ancillary testing (Order one test if clinical examination cannot be fully performed due to pt factors or if apnea testing inconclusive/aborted)
- Cerebral angiogram
- HMPAO SPECT (Single photon emission computed tomography)
- EEG & TCD (transcranial Doppler)

### Organ donation caveats
- Discussions about organ donation should take place between Tennessee Donor Services (TDS) and the surrogate. You SHOULD NOT be having conversations with the surrogate about donation. Direct questions to TDS

## Running Codes

**Author: Hannah Kieffer**

### Arrival to a Code:
- **Questions to ask when you arrive:** Who is running this code? Have we confirmed the pt's code status?
- **Calmly take charge:** Establish if anyone is actively running the code. If someone is running the code, introduce yourself and ask how you may be helpful. If someone is NOT, assume responsibility for running the code

### 1st Minute: Check in on ABCDE
- **A: Airway** – Check that patient is receiving breaths; do they need an airway adjunct?
- **B: Breathing** – Is someone bagging the patient effectively?
- **C: Compressions** – Has someone started chest compressions? Have 2-3 people in line to take over during pulse checks
- **D: Defibrillation** – Are there pads on the patient?
- **E: Epinephrine** – Make sure first dose has been given

### 2nd Minute: Set up your room
- You/the code leader stands at the foot of the bed. Do not move.
- One person on chest compressions; 2-3 people in a line behind to take over during pulse checks
- Airway manager at head of bed. Have second person to assist/hold the mask
- Someone monitoring femoral pulse
- Medication administrator
- Timer/Recorder

**Be clear and remove extra people out of the room**

### Now that your code is running:
- **Access:** IV access preferred, if no immediate IV access, place IO
- Obtain a brief medical history and events surrounding the code

### Interventions with proven mortality benefit:

**Strong ACLS:**
- Check that high quality CPR with minimal interruptions (<10s)
- Change compressors during pulse checks to decrease interruptions
- Q2min - pulse check, rhythm check, shock?
- Do NOT pause compressions for intubation
- Restart CPR immediately after defibrillation - do not check pulse until after 1 additional round of CPR after defibrillation, even if possible perfusing rhythm returns

**Early Defibrillation:** Assess the rhythm
- If Vfib/VT, immediately shock
  - For polymorphic VT, this is ischemia until proven otherwise unless the pt is on a large amount of QTc prolonging medications
- If PEA/Asystole - resume compressions

**Epinephrine:** Given every 3-5mins during CPR

**Consider Advanced Airway:**
- Intubation is not proven to increase survival over bag-mask ventilation
- Remember chest compressions save lives, not intubation. Do NOT stop compressions for intubation

**H's and T's:**
- Treat Reversible Factors
- Some of the fellows here will empirically give 2 grams of magnesium, 1 amp of D50, 1 amp of bicarb, and 1g calcium chloride at the onset of the code irrespective of presenting rhythm

### Treatable Causes of Cardiac Arrest:

| H's | T's |
|-----|-----|
| Hypoxia | Toxins |
| Hypovolemia | Tamponade |
| H+ | Tension Pneumothorax |
| Hypo/Hyper K | Thrombosis: Pulmonary |
| Hypothermia | Thrombosis: Coronary |

### Miscellaneous Advice:
- Closed Loop communication - continue giving instructions, minimize interruptions
- It can be helpful to maintain a constant verbal running summary of the course of the code and interventions that have been tried
- Have a member of the team locate an ultrasound for line placement and diagnostics
- Once code is underway, you have more time to understand specifics of patient. Ask bedside nurse for more past medical and more immediate history. Have someone look up most recent labs in Epic (looking for recent hyperK, acidosis). Can send Labs – ask for a "loaded gas"
- Allow family to be present if they want. Very Important: If family present, ensure that a healthcare provider (nurse, APP, resident, attending) is with the family (to answer questions, explain what is going on)

### Terminating a Code
- Consider initial rhythm, pt comorbidities, cardiac vs non-cardiac arrest, bedside echo findings. ROSC or rhythm changes during code?
- Persistent ETCO2 < 10 mmHg after 20min CPR has minimal survival
- Ask your team if they have any other therapies that they feel would be indicated
- Ask if anyone remains in favor of continuing CPR
- When unanimous, terminate the code and announce time of death. Thank your team. Take a moment of silence for the deceased patient

### Post-Arrest Care
- Immediately following ROSC is the most dangerous point of ACLS
- **Airway:** Secure airway if not done during code. Avoid hypoxia AND hyperoxia
- **BP:** MAPs < 65, IVF and/or pressors if needed
- If on floor, prioritize moving pt to a unit for ongoing care once hemodynamically stable enough for transfer. Would not delay for other diagnostics/interventions (lines, CXR, etc)
- **Cardiac:** Obtain EKG. Assess if urgent cardiac intervention is required for STEMI vs unstable cardiogenic shock vs VT storm or Vfib
- **Neuro:** If not following commands, consider Targeted Temperature Management. TTM is still performed at VUMC with a strict protocol and inclusion criteria. If there is any question about TTM eligibility, page the CCU fellow
- Send rainbow labs (CBC, CMP, Mg, coags, trop, lactate, VBG/ABG). Treat rapidly reversible causes
- CXR
- Propofol/fentanyl infusion if the pt is intubated. Pressor of choice post ROSC is usually levophed
- If not done during the code, obtain central access and an arterial line

### Resident Roles:
- **Intern:** Grab yellow IO kit before leaving ICU for the code. Discuss learning opportunities with senior prior to codes; consider holding femoral pulse, placing IO if needed, chest compressions if no prior experience
- **Resident:** Ask the fellow in advance if you can run the code with them standing next to you for support and assistance. This is a very important experience.

## Temperature Abnormalities

**Author: Soibhan Kelley**

### Hypothermia

#### Background
- Core temperature <35°C (95°F). Mild 32-35C (90-95F), moderate 28-32C (82-90F), or severe <28C (82F) +/- pulseless
- Ensure thermometer is "low-reading," standard thermometers not accurate
- Core temperature can be measured w/ bladder catheter probe or esophageal probe (may be falsely ↓ if heated oxygen being delivered). Rectal temp can be used but is less accurate
- **Etiologies:**
  - Heat loss: environmental, burns, iatrogenic (CRRT, cold IVF, massive transfusion protocol), vasodilatory drugs/toxins
  - Decreased heat production: endocrinopathies (hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypopituitarism, hypoglycemia), thiamine deficiency
  - Impaired regulation: Spinal cord injury, hypothalamic lesions, drugs (classes including antihyperglycemics, beta blockers, sedatives, ETOH, alpha agonists, general anesthetics)
  - Multiple mechanisms: sepsis, pancreatitis, DKA

#### Evaluation
- Infectious work-up
- POC blood glucose, TSH/FT4, cortisol, lipase, UA, UDS, EtOH level, additional tox as appropriate, DKA work-up if relevant
- Physical exam + history for exposures and trauma
- CBC, CMP, Lactate, ABG, CK, PT/PTT, Fibrinogen
- EKG

#### Management
- Treat underlying cause [see appropriate sections]
- **Mild hypothermia:**
  - Passive external rewarming (PER): blankets, increase ambient temperature
  - Note that PER requires sufficient underlying physiologic reserve to generate heat. This is often impaired in elderly pts, malnutrition, sepsis
- **Moderate hypothermia, refractory mild hypothermia, or cardiovascular instability:**
  - Active external rewarming (AER): forced warm air (ie Bair Hugger), heated blankets, heat lamps, hot packs (consider burn risk)
- **Severe hypothermia or refractory moderate hypothermia:**
  - Active core rewarming: Warmed IV crystalloid (limited rewarming potential unless large volume but will decrease ongoing losses), warmed humidified inspired air, warmed bladder lavage
  - More extreme methods such as peritoneal/thoracic lavage more likely to be used in severe environmental cases in ED
- **Pulseless severe hypothermia ("You aren't dead unless you are warm and dead"):**
  - Continue CPR until re-warmed as severe hypothermia is neuroprotective and pts can have good neurologic outcomes despite hours of CPR
  - ACLS medications and shocks will have poor effectiveness; prioritize circulation (i.e. chest compressions) and rewarming
  - Consider ECMO (likely venoarterial if pulseless); would need transfer to CVICU
- Identify and manage complications: bradycardia/heart block, arrhythmias, shock, coagulopathy/DIC, rhabdomyolysis; rebound hyperkalemia/hypoglycemia with rewarming

---

### Fever and Hyperthermia

#### Background
- **Fever:** T >38.0°C (100.4°F) driven by hypothalamus activity in response to systemic triggers (i.e. cytokines); may use lower threshold for immunocompromised pts
- **Hyperthermia:** T >41.0 C (105.8°F) uncontrolled heat production with failure of thermoregulation
- **Infectious etiologies:**
  - Considerations in the ICU include central-line associated blood stream infection, catheter-associated UTI, pneumonia (including ventilator-associated), sinusitis (esp. in pts with NGT or ETT), clostridium difficile, acalculous cholecystitis
- **Non-infectious etiologies:**
  - **Drug fever:**
    - Difficult to distinguish from other causes; Can begin hrs-wks after starting a drug
    - Sources: antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, sulfonamides), anticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital), allopurinol, heparin, dexmedetomidine
    - Drugs of abuse with sympathomimetic activity (cocaine, meth, ecstasy)
    - Anticholinergic or salicylate intoxication
  - **Idiosyncratic drug reactions:**
    - Serotonin syndrome
    - Neuroleptic malignant syndrome
    - Malignant hyperthermia
  - Transfusion reactions
  - PE/DVT
  - Endocrine: hyperthyroidism/thyroid storm, adrenal insufficiency
  - CNS pathology (intracranial bleed/stroke, particularly hypothalamic region)
  - Malignancy
  - Heat stroke (exertional or non-exertional)
  - Other inflammatory states: Pancreatitis, gout, pericarditis, pneumonitis

#### Evaluation
- Infectious work-up +/- LP; may consider pan-scan if unable to identify source
- POC glucose, BMP, LFT, Mg/Phos, CBC w/diff
- Consider coags + fibrinogen (DIC), CK/UA (rhabdo), UDS, acetaminophen and salicylate levels, TSH/FT4, cortisol, lipase, ABG
- Review medication list: antibiotics, serotonergic drugs, anti-psychotics, recent sedation for OR, or recently intubated with succinylcholine, dexmedetomidine
- Consider CT/MRI head

#### Management
- Treat underlying etiology [see appropriate sections]
  - Serotonin syndrome -> stop serotonergic drugs; add cyproheptadine
  - Malignant hyperthermia ->activate malignant hyperthermia team; add dantrolene
- **Cooling:**
  - Target <38.0°C (100.4°F)
  - Surface cooling: Ice (bath, or ice packs more likely in our MICU), evaporative cooling with misted lukewarm water and fan
  - Internal cooling: Cold IV fluids, dry ventilation (evaporative) with non-humidified nasal cannula or vent circuit
  - Avoid shivering -> give opiates (except in serotonin syndrome), precedex, propofol, benzos, ketamine
- **Antipyretics:**
  - Acetaminophen, NSAIDs
  - Block prostaglandin-mediated temperature elevations
  - Effective for most causes of fever- infection, pancreatitis, DVT/PE, pneumonitis
  - AVOID for true hyperthermia (ineffective and potentially harmful) -> neuroleptic malignant syndrome, malignant hyperthermia, serotonin syndrome, heat stroke
- **Monitor for complications:**
  - Rhabdomyolysis, DIC, arrhythmias
  - If high suspicion for infection and not improving on antibiotics, consider other infectious etiologies including fungal (e.g., candida)
