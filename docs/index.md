## Contents:

This website contains the markdown conversion of 7th Edition of the Vanderbilt Housestaff Handbook. It is maintained by Matthew Sweeney, MD and Chase Webber, MD through the VLRChat Project. It is divided to separate files by chapter. The Housestaff handbook represents a compendium of clinical and institutional information to assist with their function as resident physicians at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. This website does not represent the official VUMC online version of the housestaff handbook, that is located at https://vimbook.vumc.org.

## Purpose:

This website serves as a test-bed for VLRChat, the custom chatbot trained off of the handbook materials. 

## Notes:

The conversion from source files to the .md files displayed on this website is imperfect and occasionally arduous. Care has been taken to ensure the most accurate translation possible but there may still be errors both in content and formatting. If in doubt, double-check findings with the physical handbook. Please report any errors in factual content to both matthew.sweeney@vumc.org and chase.j.webber@vumc.org. 

Future versions of this website will contain images from the handbook.
