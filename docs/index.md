# Welcome to xlr.chat

## Contents:

This website contains the markdown conversion of 7th Edition of the Vanderbilt Housestaff Handbook. The Housestaff handbook represents a compendium of clinical and institutional information to assist with their function as resident physicians at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The handbook contents are used to train the chatbot which can be accessed in the lower right corner of this webpage. 

## Purpose:

This website exists to serve as a test bed for VLRChat, the custom chatbot trained off of the handbook materials. 

## Notes:

This website is maintained by Matthew Sweeney, MD and Chase Webber, MD through the VLRChat Project. The VLRChat Project is funded by the [Innovation Catalyst Fund](https://cttc.co/inventors/innovation-catalyst-fund). The conversion from source files to the .md files displayed on this website is imperfect. Care has been taken to ensure the most accurate translation possible but there may still be errors both in content and formatting. If in doubt, double-check findings with the physical handbook. Images are generally not included in this version, although it is planned to make them available on this website and to this chatbot in the future. Please report any errors in factual content to both matthew.sweeney@vumc.org and chase.j.webber@vumc.org. 

Please note that this website does not represent the official VUMC online version of the housestaff handbook, that is located [here](https://vimbook.vumc.org).

## And finally: WARNING

The chatbot functionality on this website is a clinical decision making support tool that is in **beta**. It has been designed specifically to minimize hallucination and provide answers that are a direct match to the handbook contents. Despite this there is always the possibility that an answer is incorrect or pulled from a knowledge source outside of the handbook itself. **Do not** use answers provided by the chatbot as your sole guide in making important clinical decisions. Again: if in doubt, fact-check answers against the physical handbook or another reliable source of clinical information.
