## General Tips

- **Vanderbilt Antibiotics Stewardship Program (VASP)** has a website (https://www.vumc.org/antimicrobial-stewardship-program/) with VUMC antibiograms, local resistance patterns
  - Cross reference with IDSA guidelines to ensure the most up to date care.

- **Does your pt need to be on precautions?** Check the Infection Prevention Website (https://www.vumc.org/infectioncontrol/12177) under 'isolation' tab or page the infection control pager in E-star paging for additional questions

- **Page 317-4376** for approval of restricted antimicrobials at VUMC (page the VA ID fellow at the VA)

- Both lab and clinicians are required by law to report diagnosis and treatment for reportable disease

## Bacteremia

**Author: VASP**

**Interpreting GenMark ePlex® Results**

### Background

- When BCx turn positive, the lab reports Gram stain and GenMark ePlex® results to help guide empiric therapy, while awaiting further species identification and susceptibilities.

### Management

- Start empiric antibiotic therapy (based on clinical picture and table below)

- Consider ordering repeat BCx x2 based on organism to document clearance
  - **Repeat for:** Staph (MRSA or MSSA), Staph lugdunensis
  - **If source control & no endovascular infxn, no need to repeat** (most other strep and GNR's)

- VUMC antibiograms (https://www.vumc.org/antimicrobial-stewardship-program/antibiograms) can be used to reference typical resistance patterns and most common organisms in blood cultures.

- **Candida in a blood culture is NEVER considered a contaminant**

### Gram Positive Cocci

Some gram-positive cocci in blood cultures are NEVER considered a contaminant whereas other gram-positive cocci are often contaminants. See algorithm for interpreting GPC in blood cultures on VASP website.

## Central Nervous System Infection

**Author: VASP**

### Bacterial Meningitis

#### Evaluation

- Blood cultures prior to antibiotics if possible

- **Head CT pre-LP, only if:** Immunocompromised, hx of CNS diseases (shunts, trauma, tumors), papilledema on exam or FND, AMS, or new onset seizure.

- **If there is a delay in obtaining head CT or LP, DO NOT delay antibiotics.**

- **Lumbar puncture** (See Procedures Section):
  - **Obtain:** Opening pressure, cell count + differential, glucose, protein, bacterial culture
  - Send an extra tube or two of CSF to the lab, if possible, to be frozen in case extra testing is needed (Order 'Miscellaneous test' and for test name put "Please freeze CSF in virology;" reference lab: VUMC, specimen type: CSF)
  - **Additional studies to consider in select pts:** HSV 1, 2 PCR (NOT antibodies), VZV PCR, VDRL, Crypto Ag, fungal and/or AFB cultures, MTB PCR, West Nile Virus Ab, Enterovirus PCR, Histoplasma Ag, or Biofire Meningitis/Encephalitis Panel. These should not be performed routinely on all pts and consult ID where management questions exist.
  - If Biofire Meningitis/Encephalitis Panel is performed, double check what is included to avoid sending duplicate individual tests (ie HSV, VZV, enterovirus, etc.) A negative cryptococcus on Biofire does not exclude disease (CSF Crypto Ag is more sensitive)

#### Management

- **Antibiotics as soon as possible**
  - Ceftriaxone 2g IV q12h + Vancomycin, adjusted for renal function
  - Piperacillin-tazobactam cannot be used due to poor CNS penetration
  - IV ampicillin 2g q4h for optional coverage of Listeria for immunocompromised pts, pregnant women, or age >50 (adjust based on renal function)
  - IV acyclovir 10 mg/kg (based on adjusted body weight) q8h, if suspected HSV or VZV meningitis, make sure to run with adequate pre-hydration with NS
  - Consider empiric PO/IV doxycycline 100mg BID if tick-borne illness is suspected

- **Steroids:** IDSA guidelines-steroids (dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg q6h) should be given 10-20 minutes before the first dose of abx, or at the same time, in pts with suspected bacterial meningitis. IF pneumococcus is isolated, continue IV steroids for 2-4 days; otherwise, can discontinue

- **ID consultation:** Duration should be guided by ID and varies based on organism recovered

### Encephalitis

#### Background

- The presence or absence of normal brain function/cognition is the important distinguishing clinical feature between encephalitis and meningitis

#### Evaluation

- MRI more sensitive that CT, although imaging may or may not demonstrate abnormal radiographic findings in pts with encephalitis

- LP – similar studies as for meningitis (see above) + BioFire MEP for ALL pts

#### Management

- Acyclovir 10mg/kg IV q8hr (based on adjusted body weight), consideration of antibacterial therapy if unable to conclusively exclude a bacterial meningitis, consideration of doxycycline if tick-borne infection is on the differential, and further treatment as guided by ID

- ID consult is strongly encouraged for all pts with suspected encephalitis

### Brain Abscess

#### Evaluation/Management

- **Consult:** Neurosurgery and ID

- Blood Cultures, HIV testing in any pt with a brain lesion

- **Empiric antibiotics:**
  - IV Vancomycin (dose per PK) + ceftriaxone 2g IV q12h + metronidazole 500mg IV/PO q6h
  - If concern for extension from otitis externa, use an antipseudomonal cephalosporin (cefepime 2g IV Q8h) instead of ceftriaxone
  - Brain abscesses generally polymicrobial, thus broad-spectrum antibiotics indicated

- Aminoglycosides, macrolides, tetracyclines (e.g. doxycycline), clindamycin, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase combinations (e.g., Zosyn) and 1st-generation cephalosporins (e.g., cefazolin) should NOT be used as they do not cross BBB at high concentration.

- **Antibiotic Duration:** based on surgical drainage and ID guidance

### Epidural Abscess

#### Management

- If spinal lesion, consult 'Spine surgery' and it will be directed to Ortho-Spine or Neurosurgery, depending on who is on call.

- Abx should be started as soon as the diagnosis of epidural abscess is suspected, immediately following the collection of two sets of blood cultures
  - Vancomycin 15-20mg/kg IV q8-12h (adjusted for renal function) + ceftriaxone 2g IV q24h (or q12hr if there is secondary meningitis)
  - Use cefepime 2g IV q8h instead of ceftriaxone if concern for Pseudomonas

- ID consult is strongly encouraged and they will guide duration

## Diabetic Foot Infection

**Author: VASP**

### Foundational Principles

- **Do NOT use antibiotics to treat uninfected wounds** as patient harm outweighs benefit.

- **ALL wounds are colonized** with microorganisms and superficial wound cultures should not be collected nor used to make treatment decisions.

- **Do NOT administer antibiotics** to clinically stable patients until deep tissue or operative cultures are obtained.

- Failure of oral antibiotics used for < 48 hours is NOT a reason to use broad-spectrum antibiotics.

### Evaluation

- Plain radiograph for all pts; MRI w/contrast if abscess/osteo suspected

- Use of inflammatory markers such as ESR or CRP at baseline may help determine level of inflammation with periodic trending (e.g. weekly) thereafter. Do NOT repeat these tests daily.

- BCx (prior to antibiotics) if systemic signs of infection, or severe infection
  - Do not culture superficial swabs of lesions, as these generally only grow colonizing organisms.

- Consider obtaining MRSA nasal PCR. (ensure collected before nasal decolonization); ~90% negative predictive values for diabetic foot infections

- Consult podiatry if osteomyelitis present for bone specimen culture and pathology (either from debridement specimen or bone biopsy) prior to starting antibiotics.

- Consult surgery if concern for abscess, gas in tissue, joint involvement

- Assess peripheral vasculature, consider arterial flow studies/vascular surgery consult

### Management

#### Assess Severity:

- **Mild:** local infection, skin/subcutaneous tissue only, erythema >0.5 cm but ≤2cm from ulcer
- **Moderate:** local infection w/erythema > 2 cm from ulcer or deeper structures included without SIRS
- **Severe:** local infection with systemic inflammation as evidenced by >2 SIRS criteria

- Consider anti-pseudomonal coverage only if at risk for Pseudomonas infection (e.g. previous Pseudomonas on culture, water exposure; hospitalization within previous 90 days AND IV antibiotic use, immunocompromise).

- Consider MRSA coverage with risk factors: previous MRSA on cultures, hospitalization within previous 90 days AND IV antibiotic use, IV drug use, hemodialysis

- Consider anaerobic coverage with metronidazole

#### Treatment Regimens:

|  | Non-purulent, no MRSA risk factors | Purulent, MRSA risk factors | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mild** | **Preferred:**<br>• Cephalexin 500mg PO QID or 1g TID<br>• Cefadroxil 1g PO BID (upon discharge only)<br><br>**Alternative:**<br>Amoxicillin/clavulanate 875/125mg PO BID | **MRSA only with risk factors:**<br>• Doxycycline 100mg PO BID (add to β-lactam)<br>Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 5-8mg/kg/day (alone)—Preferred if severe penicillin allergy | 7-14 days |
| **Moderate** | **Preferred:**<br>• Ampicillin/sulbactam 3g IV Q6H<br>• Ceftriaxone 2g IV daily ± PO metronidazole 500mg Q12H<br><br>**P. aeruginosa only with risk factors (change to):**<br>• Piperacillin/tazobactam 3.375g IV Q8H ext infusion<br>• Cefepime 2g IV Q8H ± metronidazole 500mg PO Q12H<br>• Levofloxacin 750mg PO daily ± metronidazole 500mg PO Q12H | **MRSA only with risk factors (add):**<br>• Doxycycline 100mg PO BID<br>• Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 5-8mg/kg/day for SSTI and 8-12mg/kg/day for osteomyelitis<br>• Linezolid 600mg PO BID<br>Vancomycin (pharmacy consult) | 7 – 21 days for soft tissue infection only<br><br>**If osteomyelitis:**<br>-24-48 hours if complete resection of infected tissue<br>-1 – 3 weeks if only residual soft tissue infection<br>3 – 6 weeks if residual bone infection with resection or 4 – 6 weeks without resection |
| **Severe** | **Preferred:**<br>-Ceftriaxone 2g IV daily + metronidazole 500mg PO Q12H<br>**PLUS**<br>-Vancomycin (pharmacy consult), OR<br>-Linezolid 600mg PO BID†<br><br>**P. aeruginosa only with risk factors (change to):**<br>• Piperacillin/tazobactam 3.375g IV Q8H ext infusion<br>• Cefepime 2g IV Q8H + metronidazole 500mg PO Q12H<br><br>†Linezolid is preferred for use in necrotizing soft tissue infections<br><br>Adjust regimen based on deep culture results | | 7 – 28 days for soft tissue infection only<br><br>**If osteomyelitis:**<br>• 48 hours if complete resection of infected tissue<br>• 7 – 21 days if only residual soft tissue infection<br>21 – 42 days if residual bone infection with resection or 28 – 42 days without resection |

#### Conversion to PO antibiotics (including osteomyelitis):

- Active agent available
- Functioning GI tract
- Clinically stable
- Select active agent(s) against recovered pathogen(s)

### Additional Information

- If pt HDS, hold abx until deep tissue/operative cultures obtained.

- Most diabetic foot infections are polymicrobial in nature.

- Culture results will help therapy, but all pathogens identified may not require treatment. Would discuss with ID if complex

## Endocarditis

**Author: Justin Smith**

### Background

- **Multiple etiologies of endocarditis:**

  - **Typical Bacterial**
    - S. aureus, Enterococcus spp (E. faecalis most commonly), viridans group streptococci, Strep gallolyticus (formerly S. bovis)
    - HACEK: Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, Kingella

  - **Other infectious**
    - Culture negative: often recent antimicrobial exposure, slow growing organism
    - Coxiella, Brucella, Bartonella, Chlamydia, Legionella, Mycoplasma, Tropheryma whipplei, Cutibacterium acnes (formerly P. acnes)
    - Fungal: Candida and aspergillus most common

  - **Non-infectious:** a.k.a., marantic endocarditis, Libman-Sacks Endocarditis
    - Rare, most common in advanced malignancy, SLE, inflammatory conditions
    - Higher risk for embolization compared to IE

- **Risk factors:** IV drug use, congenital heart disease, valve abnormalities, intracardiac devices, recent cardiac surgery

### Presentation

- Fever (90%), murmur (85%), other: splenomegaly, splinter hemorrhages, Janeway lesions, Osler nodes, Roth spots

- Persistent bacteremia despite appropriate treatment, new onset cardiac dysfunction, new onset valve abnormalities, stroke, other thromboembolic events, metastatic infections/abscesses, splenic abscess, septic pulmonary emboli

### Duke Criteria:

#### Pathologic Criteria
- **Microorganisms:** culture or histology proven: vegetation, embolus, or intracardiac abscess
- **Pathologic vegetations:** vegetation of abscess with histology proven endocarditis

#### Clinical Criteria
- **Definite:** 2 Major, 1 major and 3 minor, or 5 minor
- **Possible:** 1 major and 1 minor, or 3 minor
- **Rejected:** firm alternate diagnosis, resolution of evidence with <4 days of antibiotics, or absence of pathologic evidence with <4days of antibiotics

| Major Criteria | Minor Criteria |
|----------------|----------------|
| 2x positive blood cultures from a typical organism | Predisposing heart condition/IDU |
| Evidence of endocardial involvement | Fever |
| | Vascular phenomena (glomerulonephritis) |
| | Immunologic phenomena (Osler nodes, Roth spots, +rheumatoid factor, GN) |
| | Micro (cultures that don't fit the above, or serologic evidence of acute infection) |

### Evaluation

- **Physical exam:** murmur, decreased peripheral perfusion, evidence of heart failure, petechiae, splinter hemorrhages, Janeway lesions/Osler nodes, organomegaly

- **Blood cultures:** at least three sets from different sites over a span of several hours

- **Echo (TTE vs TEE)**
  - It can be reasonable to start with TEE if pretest probability is high enough, if pt already has known valvular abnormalities, or TTE will be technically difficult

- **EKG:** new heart block or prolonged PR raises concern for endocardial/perivalvular abscess. Endocarditis pts should be on telemetry, monitored closely by team.

- **CXR:** infiltrates suggestive of septic pulmonary emboli, pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly

- Imaging of distant affected site if concerned for septic emboli

- Other advanced imaging in select scenario: cardiac CTA, cardiac MRI, FDG-PET/CT

### Management

- **Empiric antibiotics:**
  - If bacteria isolated from blood, reference bacteremia section for abx choice
  - If awaiting cultures
    - **Native valve:** Vancomycin +/- GNR coverage (depending on clinical stability, risk factors, etc)
    - **Prosthetic valve:** Vancomycin and cefepime, consider gentamicin

- **Antibiotic Duration:** determined by ID, often 4-6 weeks

- **Cardiac surgery consult:** if valve dysfunction, perivalvular abscess, large (>20mm) vegetations, heart block, ongoing embolization on abx, delayed Cx clearance (>1 week on abx)

### Additional Information:

#### Complications:

- **Cardiac:**
  - **Heart failure:** usually secondary to valve dysfunction. Most common when aortic valve involved, risk also depends on organism (worst is Staph aureus)
  - **Perivalvular abscess:** suspect when there are conduction abnormalities on EKG.
  - **Pericarditis:** can be suppurative or non-suppurative
  - **Intracardiac Fistula**

- Septic emboli and metastatic abscesses

- **Mycotic aneurysm:** usually occurs at vessel branch points

#### Follow Up

- Repeat TTE at completion of treatment to establish new baseline
- Followed for valvular dysfunction with frequency determined by nature of the dysfunction
- Regular dental care; prior IE is an indication for SBE prophylaxis with dental work.

- Episode of IE is an indication for PDA or VSD closure

## Fever in a Return Traveler

**Author: Michael Daw**

### Background

- Treatment of fever in a return traveler will depend on where the traveler came from and what risk their fever poses to themselves or others.

- **ALWAYS remember to think about common US illnesses** that are frequently transmitted due to exposure to crowds in airports, airplanes, bus stations, etc (mononucleosis (EBV and CMV), influenza, other common cold viruses, etc.)

### Presentation

- **Is the pt sick?** AMS, tachypneic, hypotensive

- **Do they have signs of severe disease?** Cyanosis, meningism (nuchal rigidity, photophobia, headache), peritonitis, digital gangrene

#### History Pearls

- Obtain travel history: location(s), activities, purpose of travel, accommodations
- Did they visit a friend or relative? (less likely to seek pretravel medical advice, higher risk for malaria, typhoid fever, tuberculosis, hepatitis A, and STD)
- Consumption of unclean water or risky foods, insect/tick bites, animal exposures, sexual contact
- Were they hospitalized abroad? (consider MDR organisms)
- Evaluate immunization status and chemoprophylaxis received before/during travel.
- Check out the CDC Yellow Book: https://www.cdc.gov/yellow-book/index.html

### Etiologies based on clinical syndrome:

| Clinical Syndrome | Possible Etiologies |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Skin rash with or without conjunctivitis and fever | measles, typhus, dengue, chikungunya (both dengue and chikungunya tend to also cause severe muscle and joint aches), Zika, meningococcemia, hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola |
| Rapid respiratory rate | influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS], pneumonic plague, histoplasmosis |
| Persistent cough | TB, pertussis, fungal infections like coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, cryptococcus |
| Decreased consciousness | malaria, meningococcal meningitis, rabies, tickborne encephalitis |
| Bruising or unusual bleeding without previous injury | hemorrhagic fevers |
| Persistent voluminous diarrhea | campylobacter, shigella, salmonella – although many do not usually present with fever - Traveler's diarrhea, cholera, giardiasis |
| Persistent vomiting other than air or motion sickness | norovirus |
| Jaundice | hepatitis A, B (if not vaccinated), D, E; leptospirosis |
| Flaccid paralysis of recent onset | polio |
| Genital lesions | HIV, G/C, hepatitis, syphilis, Mpox, hemorrhagic fevers, lymphogranuloma venereum |

### If no localizing symptoms, consider usual incubation periods:

- **<21 days:** East African trypanosomiasis, dengue, Zika, chikungunya, Japanese encephalitis, leptospirosis, malaria, meningococcemia, nontyphoidal salmonellosis, plague, typhoid fever, typhus, viral hemorrhagic fevers, yellow fever

- **>21 days:** acute HIV, acute systemic schistosomiasis, amebic liver abscess, borreliosis (relapsing fever), brucellosis, leishmaniasis, malaria (esp after ineffective prophylaxis), rabies, TB, viral hepatitides, West African trypanosomiasis

- **Relapsing fevers** (fever spikes separated by days or weeks): borreliosis, malaria
  - 48 hour interval fevers: plasmodium vivax or P ovale
  - 72 hour fevers: Plasmodium malariae
  - intermittent, unsynchronized: P falciparum

- **Domestic travelers** (within the US), consider: tickborne illness (ehrlichia, anaplasmosis, STARI, Lyme, Rocky Mtn Spotted fever), coccidiomycosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, cryptococcus, tularemia, hantavirus

### Evaluation:

- Most common serious cause of fever from travel to certain areas is **malaria falciparum**: order thick and thin blood smears and note that the order is for malaria blood smear (if you order thick and thin w/o malaria order, it will not be done in an urgent manner). If negative, order repeat smears over 24-72 hrs.

- **Viral hemorrhagic fevers** such as Ebola, Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever, Marburg hemorrhagic fever, and Lassa fever are highly transmissible and require immediate treatment. IF suspicious, VUMC Infection prevention should be notified IMMEDIATELY. Special precautions and protocols should be initiated to protect treating team.

- **Initial labs:** CBC w/diff, CMP, blood cx, rapid tests for malaria and dengue, PCR testing of plasma sample (for tick borne), CXR, blood smear (thick and thin), UA with microscopy and culture. Consider O&P, head imaging or LP, or additional abdominal imaging in the right clinical context.

- Don't forget the common causes of fever (could have nothing to do with pt's travel or could be routine infections seen in US)

- Empiric doxycycline is a reasonable adjunct for undifferentiated non-malaria fevers

- Look up current outbreaks to help guide clinical suspicion. https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news

## Fungal Infections

**Author: Ally Glover**

### Evaluation

- Bacterial BCx can detect candidemia but low sensitivity (50%). Fungal blood cultures also with low sensitivity.

- **Beta-d-glucan:** note will not be elevated in mucormycosis, cryptococcosis, and blastomycosis.

- **Aspergillus galactomannan:** BAL > serum.

- Pts with risk factors for candidemia (TPN, chronic line, GI disease, persistent neutropenic fever) with concerning clinical syndrome can be treated empirically with micafungin.

## Candida Infections

### Background

- Part of normal flora of human GI and GU tract

- Broad range of associated diseases from vaginal candidiasis to candidemia

- **Pts at highest risk of severe / invasive candida infection (candidemia):**
  - Burn / surgical ICU pts
  - Solid organ recipients
  - Chemo pts / malignant heme pts
  - TPN dependent / central access pts (especially in ICU)

### Presentation

- **Oropharyngeal:** white plaques/patches in mouth +/- erythema, painful when eating

- **Esophageal:** dysphagia/odynophagia, chest pain w/ swallowing

- **Vulvovaginitis:** white, thick discharge; pruritus/erythema

- **Balanitis:** white patches on penis with severe burning/itching

- **Mastitis:** breast feeding pts with nipple injury

- **Invasive focal infections**
  - **UTI:** ascending infection (can often be unilateral) vs. hematologic source (micro abscesses)
  - **Peritonitis:** often in peritoneal dialysis pts
  - **Mediastinitis:** often post thoracic surgery
  - **Hepatosplenic:** often in pts who just recovered from neutropenia in setting of heme malignancy
  - **Candidemia:** sepsis, often in setting of critical illness, think about when above risk factors present

### Evaluation

- **Blood:** candida is NEVER a contaminant in blood cultures

- **Urine:** culture is standard method of identification but RARELY a urinary pathogen

### Management

- **Candidemia / critical illness:** start micafungin 100mg daily, consult ID

- **Vulvovaginitis:** fluconazole 150mg x1 if mild, 150mg every 72 hrs for 2-3 doses if severe

- **Oropharyngeal:** nystatin oral suspension if mild thrush, if moderate – severe candidiasis then fluconazole 100-200mg qday for 7-14 days

- **Esophageal candidiasis (AIDS defining illness):** fluconazole 200-400mg qday or micafungin 150mg daily for 14-21 days as an alternative agent

### Additional information

- Remember to check susceptibilities (C krusei has intrinsic azole resistance and C glabrata has high rates of fluconazole resistance)

## Aspergillosis

### Background

- Most often in pts who have prolonged neutropenia, high dose steroids, or other immunosuppressive drug regimen or condition

- Take thorough hx: farming, occupational exposure where pt might have inhaled conidia

### Presentation

- **Classic pulmonary aspergillosis presentation:** neutropenic pt with fever, pleuritic chest pain and hemoptysis

- **Tracheobronchitis:** can occur in lung transplant pts

### Evaluation

- Aspergillus galactomannan Ag

- Lung imaging if concerned for pulmonary aspergillosis

- Differentiate possible vs probable vs proven (tissue) aspergillosis as it can reflect colonization without proper clinical syndrome or host

### Management

- Consult ID. Usually treat with voriconazole or other triazole (posaconazole, isavuconazole). Preferred over amphotericin based on clinical trials.

- **Fluconazole is NOT active against aspergillus**

## Blastomycosis

### Background

- Endemic in midwest, southeast, southern central US, and parts of Canada that border the Great Lakes

- Mostly pulmonary manifestations, 25-40% of infections w/ extrapulmonary involvement (skin, bone, GU, and CNS presentations)

### Presentation

- **Pulmonary symptoms common:** dyspnea, cough, fever, hemoptysis, chest pain

- Verrucous lesions with irregular borders

- Osteolytic bone lesions

- Draining sinuses

### Evaluation:

- Serum and urine blastomycosis Ag

- Antibody testing less useful in acute disease (interpret with caution)

### Management

- **Pulmonary blastomycosis**
  - **Mild to Moderate:** itraconazole 6-12 months
  - **Moderate to Severe:** ampho followed by itraconazole for 6-12 months

- **Disseminated extrapulmonary blastomycosis:** ampho followed by itraconazole for a year
  - Note: in anyone who is immunosuppressed, especially pts with AIDS, start with amphotericin

- **CNS blastomycosis:** 4-6 weeks of ampho followed by a year of itraconazole

## Histoplasmosis

### Background

- The most common endemic mycosis in the US. Endemic to Ohio and Mississippi river valley.

- Most infections are not clinically significant / do not require treatment.

- **At risk for disseminated disease** (HIV, transplant recipients, immunocompromised, TNF-alpha inhibitors, elderly)

- **Differential diagnosis:** TB, malignancy, sarcoidosis, other fungal infection

### Presentation

- **Pulmonary histo:** pna w/ mediastinal or hilar LND or masses, pulmonary nodules, cavitation

- **Disseminated histo:** fever, mediastinal LND, diffuse pulm interstitial infiltrates, HSM, liver involvement, popular rash, cytopenias, mucosal lesions, ↑ LDH, ferritin, adrenal involvement, colonic involvement.

### Evaluation

- Send BOTH Urine and Serum antigens. Requires attending name to order.

- Antibody testing less useful in acute disease (interpret with caution)

- Other diagnostics to consider: peripheral smear/buffy coat, fungal blood cultures, LDH, ferritin, BAL with cultures and cytology

- Remember histo Ag has high cross reactivity with blasto Ag

### Management:

- Amphotericin and Itraconazole- discuss with ID, pharmacy about dosing, duration.

- **Pulmonary histo:**
  - **Mediastinal granuloma, fibrosis, broncholithiasis:** usually no tx.
  - **Mild-moderate acute pulmonary histo:** itraconazole if persistent symptoms > 1mo
  - **Chronic cavitations:** itraconazole, likely 1 to 2 years
  - **Severe acute pulmonary histo:** amphotericin for 1-2 weeks +/- methylprednisolone followed by itraconazole for 12 weeks

- **Disseminated histo:**
  - **Mild-moderate disseminated disease:** itraconazole for ~12 months
  - **Severe disseminated disease:** ampho for 1-2 weeks followed by itraconazole for ~12 mo

### Additional information

- Disseminated histoplasmosis can be associated with secondary HLH. Follow CBC closely.

- If concerned for sarcoidosis, need to rule out histo prior to starting treatment for sarcoidosis

- Urine antigen can be used to trend response to treatment

## Genitourinary Infection

**Author: VASP**

### Asymptomatic Bacteriuria

#### Background

- Isolation of bacteria in an appropriately collected urine specimen from an individual without symptoms or signs of urinary tract infection. Bacteriuria, foul odor, urine appearance, pyuria, falls and/or confusion alone are not indicative of infection.

- Oliguric ESRD pts may have bacteriuria from colonization due to lack of flushing of bladder; avoid sending UA/UCx unless pt is symptomatic

- **Treatment only required for specific populations:**
  - Pregnant women (screening performed at 12 – 16 weeks)
  - Anticipated urologic intervention - when requesting, be sure to ask for Micro help in identifying potential pathogens needing treatment vs. likely contaminants
  - Some renal transplant recipients, depending on time since transplant

### Complicated UTI and Pyelonephritis

See UTI algorithm (https://www.vumc.org/antimicrobial-stewardship-program/guidelines) on VASP website

#### Background

- Fever, pyuria, and costovertebral angle tenderness suggest pyelonephritis.

- **Consider it a complicated UTI if any of the following are present:**
  - Renal calculi or other obstructive disease, immunosuppressed host, abnormal urological anatomy or physiology (including stents), presence of a urinary catheter
  - Male sex alone does NOT qualify as complicated
  - Sepsis or bacteremia

#### Evaluation

- UA with reflex urine culture ONLY in patients with symptoms

- If unable to obtain history, evaluate for objective signs of infection (fever, hypotension, tachycardia, leukocytosis, etc.) and evaluate for alternative explanations (O2 requirement suggest pneumonia, post-op fever within 48 hours, etc.)

- BCx and UCx prior to abx

- If there is no pyuria, consider an alternative diagnosis, or proximal ureteral obstruction
  - Pyuria is common in the presence of a urinary catheter, kidney stones, urostomy, ileal conduit and other invasive devices, and may not indicate infection

#### Management

- **Antibiotic Duration:** 7-14 days, depending on antibiotic choice

- Tailor therapy once/if cultures are available. If no improvement in 48h, consider imaging to rule out complications (e.g., perinephric abscess)
  - Transition from IV to PO should be considered for patients who meet the following criteria: able to tolerate enteral medications, signs of clinical improvement (defervesced, afebrile, down-trending WBC, etc.)
  - Days of IV therapy count towards overall treatment duration.

|  | First Line | Alternative |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| **Outpt** | Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 875-125mg BID x14 days | Ciprofloxacin 500mg BID or levofloxacin 750 mg daily x 7 days<br>TMP/SMX 1-2 DS BID x 7 days |
| **Inpt** | Ceftriaxone 2g q24h<br>Cefepime 2g q8h<br>Pip/tazo 3.375g q8h ext infusion<br>Meropenem 1g q8h (if h/o or confirmed ESBL within the last 90 days) | Ertapenem 1g q24 instead of Meropenem if no Pseudomonas<br>Ciprofloxacin 750mg PO BID (500 mg PO BID if bacteremia ruled out) OR 400mg IV BID (if susceptibility confirmed)*<br>*FQ's have same bioavailability if given PO or IV so oral is preferred |

### Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)

#### Background

- Clinical symptoms of UTI (dysuria/urgency/frequency/ hematuria) in non-pregnant, immunocompetent, neurologically intact pt with normal urologic anatomy and no indwelling urinary catheters

#### Management

- **Empiric therapy**
  - Nitrofurantoin monohydrate: 100 mg PO BID x 5 days (avoid if any concern for pyelonephritis or if creatinine clearance <30)
  - Cephalexin 250-500mg q6h x5-7 days

- **Alternative therapies**
  - Fosfomycin: 3 grams of powder mixed in water as a single PO dose (avoid if any concern for ascending UTI or pyelonephritis). Susceptibility test results must be requested, only possible for E. coli and E. Faecalis.
  - Amoxicillin-clavulanate: 875-125mg PO BID x5-7 days
  - Ciprofloxacin: 250mg PO BID x3 days
  - FQ's should be reserved for more serious infections than uncomplicated cystitis, and only after susceptibility results are confirmed given high rates of resistance
    - Adverse effect profile >> beta-lactams (i.e. QT-prolongation, tendinopathies)

- Avoid amoxicillin, ampicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) due to increasing resistance unless culture data with confirmed susceptibility

#### Additional Information

- **MDR cystitis:** ESBL isolates are increasingly common due to antibiotic overuse
  - Before treating, decide if this is a TRUE UTI
  - If true, consider Fosfomycin (if E. coli) or nitrofurantoin (if susceptibility is confirmed – K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter spp are usually resistant), gentamicin or tobramycin 5 mg/kg IV once (even in setting of AKI), or ID consultation
  - Ask the lab to check susceptibility results to these antibiotics for future reference

### Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI)

#### Background

- Culture growth of > 10³ cfu/mL of uropathogenic bacteria + signs or symptoms consistent with infection (without another identified etiology) + indwelling urethral/suprapubic catheter or intermittent catheterization.
  - This includes pts with catheters in place during the preceding 48 hours

- **Duration = greatest risk factor** (increases 3-10% per day of catheterization)
  - Other risks: female sex, diabetes, elderly, colonization of catheter bag, poor care

- Bacteriuria, foul odor, pyuria, urine appearance falls and/or confusion alone are not indicative of infection in pts who are otherwise asymptomatic.

- **Ensure clean sample collected**
  - Ideally, catheter is removed and midstream sample obtained
  - If catheterization required; removal of old catheter and sample taken from new catheter

#### Management

- Distinguish uncomplicated vs complicated UTI (see above)

- **Antimicrobial management:**
  - Guided by cultures and susceptibilities
  - Duration: 7 – 14 days depending on abx, clinical response and whether infection constitutes complicated vs uncomplicated UTI
  - Special note regarding Candida UTI management: Candida is generally not pathogenic
    - Presence in urine does not indicate infection (unless perinephric abscess, renal transplant, or complex fistulous disease)
    - Fluconazole achieves excellent urinary penetration while micafungin does not
    - If fluconazole-resistant Candida is cultured or suspected, consult ID
    - Susceptibilities are not routinely run-on Candida from urine cultures and would need to be requested if concern for true infection.

- **Catheter management**
  - At the least, catheters should be replaced at the time of antibiotic initiation (preferably removed).
  - If catheterization is necessary, intermittent catheterization is preferred over continuous use with pt educations on cleaning/hygiene prior to catheterization. Condom catheters and pure wicks also preferred over foley catheter.

## GI Infections

**Authors: Lin Cao, Ahmed Samy**

### Acute Diarrhea

#### Presentation

- ≥3 BMs/day or abnormally loose stools

- Vast majority of infectious diarrhea cases are acute with more persistent diarrhea, consider additional workup for noninfectious etiologies as well

- Can be watery or inflammatory (bloody stools, signs of sepsis, severe abdominal pain)

- **History:** food hx (particularly undercooked meats or unpasteurized dairy), occupational exposures, recent travel, pet and animal exposures, immunocompromised

#### Evaluation

- **Exam:** volume status, abdominal pain

- **Labs:** CBC for leukocytosis/eosinophilia, BMP for electrolyte abnormalities, BCx if c/f systemic illness, consider GIPP or stool testing if severe illness or immunocompromise

#### Management

- Most cases are self-limited and resolve with just supportive care

- **Antimotility agents:** bismuth subsalicylate, loperamide
  - Avoid antimotility agents with C. diff and inflammatory diarrhea

- Avoid abx with Shigella and EHEC (can precipitate HUS), Salmonella (prolongs carrier time)

- **Antibiotics only indicated with severe illness or certain immunocompromised hosts:**
  - Cipro 500mg bid
  - Levofloxacin 500mg qd 3-5 days
  - Azithro 500mg qd 3 days

### C. Diff (see GI section)

### Other GI Infections:

Less commonly infectious than acute diarrheal illnesses

#### Whipple disease (T. whipplei):

- Constellation of arthralgias (can be the first symptom to appear), weight loss, chronic intermittent diarrhea, abdominal pain

- **Dx:** upper endoscopy with biopsy with PAS and PCR testing for T. whipplei, can sometimes also do testing from synovial fluid/lymph nodes/etc

- **Tx:** CTX 2g IV daily or PCN 2 MU IV q4h x 2 wks followed by Bactrim 1 DS tablet bid x 1 yr

#### Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO):

- Presents with bloating, abdominal discomfort, watery diarrhea

- More commonly seen in pts with intestinal motility disorders, chronic pancreatitis, post-surgical changes (adhesions/strictures/blind loops)

- Immunocompromised pts: consider CMV, MAC, TB, fungal etiologies, cryptosporidium

- **Tx:** Rifaximin 1650mg qdaily for 14 days

#### H. pylori (see GI section)

#### Acute cholangitis (see GI section):

### Viral Hepatitis (A-E):

- Also consider HSV (especially in pregnancy), VZV, EBV, CMV though less common and usually seen more in immunocompromised pts

#### Evaluation

- HAV, HBV, HCV IgG with PCR, HDV, HEV, EBV Qt, CMV Qt, HSV Qt, VZV IgM/IgG

- **LFTs:** elevated AST/ALT (ALT>AST generally) that often precedes elevation of bilirubin

- Can present on a spectrum of severity ranging from elevated LFTs to acute liver failure; get hepatology involved early for evaluation and monitoring

### Hepatitis A

- **Presentation:** self-limited, N/V, fever, malaise, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine

- **Transmission:** Fecal oral transmission

- **Tx:** supportive care, vaccine available

### Hepatitis B

- **Transmission:** perinatal, sexual contact, parenteral

#### Acute:

- **Presentation:** Most pts have subclinical hepatitis but can present with serum sickness-like syndrome, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, RUQ pain, elevated LFTs

- **Tx:** Generally supportive care unless severe illness, then generally treat with tenofovir/entecavir

- HBV is less likely to become chronic than HCV

#### Chronic:

- **Presentation:** Generally asymptomatic but can progress to cirrhosis and HCC

- **Extrahepatic manifestations** 2/2 circulating immune complexes: polyarteritis nodosa, membranous nephropathy, aplastic anemia

- **Tx:** entecavir/tenofovir, involve GI/ID, based on development of cirrhosis, ALT, HBV DNA level, immunosuppressed status.

- Vaccine available

### Hepatitis C

- **Transmission:** parenteral, blood transfusion (prior to 1992), sexual, perinatal transmission
  - USPSTF recommends screening in all adults 18-79

#### Acute Presentation

- Generally asymptomatic but may have jaundice, nausea, dark urine, RUQ pain, elevated LFTs

- Majority of hep C cases progress to chronic infection

#### Chronic Presentation:

- Nonspecific nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, anorexia, weakness but can progress to cirrhosis and HCC, LFTs not always elevated

- **Extrahepatic manifestations** directly related to viral infection: essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, thyroiditis, porphyria cutanea tarda, lichen planus, etc.

- **Tx:** antivirals targeted to HCV genotype, however, there are pangenotypic regimens. Recheck viral load after 12 wks

### Hepatitis D

- Requires HBV for infection, consider screening with HBV

### Hepatitis E

- **Presentation:** self-limited acute infection with jaundice, malaise, anorexia, N/V, ab pain

- **Transmission:** Fecal oral transmission

- Significantly higher mortality in pregnant individuals

## HIV/AIDS and ART

**Authors: Kathryn Snyder and Quinton Taylor**

### Background

#### New HIV Diagnosis

- ID consult if pt is not on Rogers ID service (important for initiation, follow up [CCC], social work assistance)

- ART is indicated for all HIV+ pts, regardless of CD4; however, starting ART requires appropriate outpt follow up

- **Lab evaluation**
  - HIV viral load and genotype
  - T cell subsets (CD4 Count), CBC with differential, CMP, UA
  - HLA*B5701 testing before using abacavir containing regimen
  - QuantiFERON Gold
  - Pregnancy testing
  - Viral hepatitis serologies
  - Toxoplasma serologies
  - CMP, CBC with differential, urinalysis
  - Other STI screening (Syphilis, Gonorrhea/Chlamydia)

#### Timing of ART initiation

- **Factors affecting timing of initiation**
  - Drug toxicity and interactions, risks for resistance, adherence barriers
  - Treatment of opportunistic infections may delay initiation of ART given associated risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)
  - Delay ART for several weeks after initiation of therapy for cryptococcal meningitis, tuberculosis, and CMV retinitis
  - **IRIS** is a collection of inflammatory disorders associated with paradoxical worsening of preexisting infectious processes following the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-infected individuals. Symptoms are associated with underlying disease.

#### ART plan for overnight admits:

- okay to continue home ART, special consideration for:
  - Pts with hepatic or renal dysfunction may need dose adjustment
  - Interactions with other newly initiated medications
  - If there is concern for non-adherence, can hold morning dose
  - Combination pills may need to be ordered as separate components
  - Close attention to medication reconciliation to ensure the pt's complete ART regimen is ordered

#### Common key regimens for initiation

- Most regimens consist of an NRTI backbone (2 agents) plus a 3rd agent

- Some dual therapy regimens (such as Dovato®) are non-inferior to standard 3-drug therapy

- Many pts are started on combination pill regimens, including Integrase Inhibitor based regimens: Biktarvy®, Dovato®, Triumeq®, Genvoya®, dolutegravir + Descovy®

## AIDS Defining Clinical Conditions

**Author: Rebecca Choudhury**

AIDS is defined by HIV infection with concurrent absolute CD4 count <200, CD4 percentage <14%, or one of the following conditions (predominately opportunistic infections and HIV associated malignancies):

### Neurologic/Ophthalmologic

#### CNS toxoplasmosis

- **Presentation:** Variable, depending on disease burden/location, may include AMS, headache, seizure, ataxia, and focal neurologic deficits, +/- fever and flu-like symptoms

- **Evaluation:** MRI w/ring-enhancing lesions on brain imaging, serum Toxoplasma IgG/IgM and (ideally) CSF Toxoplasma PCR (though CSF Toxoplasma PCR has a low sensitivity). Response to empiric therapy (~90% will have radiographic improvement after 14 days) can also be diagnostic. Brain biopsy may be indicated if diagnostic uncertainty.

- **Management:** Pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and leucovorin is the preferred regimen, discuss dosing with pharmacy. Alternative regimens: clindamycin + pyrimethamine + leucovorin, Bactrim, atovaquone + pyrimethamine + leucovorin

#### Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)

- **Presentation:** chronic (weeks to months), progressive neurologic dysfunction, particularly incoordination and other motor dysfunction, aphasia, sometimes cognitive impairment and personality changes

- **Evaluation:** MRI brain w/patchy areas of demyelination in the subcortical white matter; location is variable, but parietal, occipital, and cerebellar involvement are common. JC virus PCR from CSF. Brain biopsy.

- **Management:** Initiation of ART (there is no specific JC virus-directed therapy), IRIS may occur in which case clinical worsening before improvement may be seen. Fatal if HIV goes untreated.

#### HIV-related encephalopathy

- **Presentation:** Similar to other progressive dementias, with short term memory loss followed by worsening global cognitive dysfunction, motor deficits, sometimes seizures in late stages

- **Evaluation:** MRI w/diffuse cerebral atrophy and/or demyelinating lesions similar to PML. CSF w/elevated protein +/- lymphocytic pleocytosis, with no alternative cause. Send HIV RNA from the CSF, usually + in HIV encephalopathy

#### Cryptococcal meningitis

- **Presentation:** Subacute to chronically worsening HA and fevers; meningismus and photophobia may be present but are often absent; rarely, focal neurologic deficits

- **Evaluation:** LP to check opening pressure and can send serum and CSF Cryptococcus Ag, CSF culture. Brain imaging may be non-diagnostic

- **Treatment:** Induction therapy with amphotericin and flucytosine x14 days (at least), with repeat LP close to end of induction to confirm CSF inflammation is improving and culture is negative (note: Cryptococcus grows well on standard bacterial culture media). Following sterilization of CSF, consolidation therapy consists of high dose fluconazole for at least 8 weeks, followed by maintenance therapy with fluconazole for one year. Pts may require serial LP or VP shunt to manage ICP.
  - Delay ART for several weeks after start of treatment to avoid risk of IRIS.

#### CMV retinitis (with vision loss)

- **Presentation:** Blurry vision, focal blind spots, visual field deficits, or scotomas and floaters. Typically begins unilateral, though often progresses to bilateral involvement.

- **Evaluation:** Always consult ophtho if you suspect it! May cause complete retinal detachment. Check serum CMV PCR (or vitreous if able)

- **Management:** IV ganciclovir or PO valgancyclovir (+intravitreous ganciclovir or foscarnet in severe disease). If not on ART, must delay ART for at least 2 weeks after start of CMV retinitis treatment to prevent immune recovery uveitis

### Pulmonary

#### Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP)

- **Presentation:** fever, shortness of breath, cough (usually non-productive), sometimes night sweats and weight loss. Hypoxia out of proportion to exam.

- **Evaluation:** CT chest appearance usually bilateral and diffuse with GGOs and cystic lesions of varying size. Large cysts can rupture, causing pneumothorax.
  - Transbronchial biopsy, BAL, or induced sputum with cytology and GMS stain.
  - Sputum Pneumocystis PCR can be done, but this is a send-out with long turn-around-time
  - Consider serum LDH and 1,3-BD-glucan: should be elevated, but are nonspecific.

- **Management:** Bactrim is the preferred treatment; PO is preferable as Bactrim is 100% bioavailable. Check ABG on ROOM AIR to consider of adding adjunctive steroids (If A-a gradient >/=35 mmHg and/or PaO2 <70 mmHg). Alternative regimens may include primaquine + clindamycin or IV (NOT inhaled) pentamidine.

#### Pulmonary tuberculosis

- **Presentation:** With low CD4, can have upper lobe cavities but also atypical radiographic pattern, including a normal-appearing CXR. Have a high degree of suspicion in any pt with advanced HIV and respiratory complaints.

- **Evaluation:** TB skin tests and IGRAs have a high false negative rate in advanced HIV. At VUMC, any pt with HIV and respiratory complaints must be placed on airborne until TB ruleout- 3 sputum mycobacterial smears/cultures collected at least 8 hours apart (or 2 smears/cultures with 1 GeneXpert) . If concentrated smear is negative x3, TB is unlikely (though have to follow up final culture to be sure).

- **Management:** RIPE therapy is the standard initial treatment, with adjustment if needed for drug resistance or contraindications

#### Herpes simplex tracheobronchitis and/or pneumonitis/pneumonia

- **Evaluation:** bronchoscopy with positive HSV PCR from BAL +/- lung biopsy. (Usually associated with HSV-1)

- **Management:** agent and duration not well defined for bronchopulmonary disease; depending on severity of presentation, likely IV acyclovir to start followed by transition to PO antiviral once evidence of clinical improvement, for a total of 10-14 days.

### Gastrointestinal

#### Esophageal candidiasis

- **Presentation:** Dysphagia, odynophagia or both. Concurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis ("thrush') is common but not universal.

- **Evaluation:** Typically presumptive. Treatment is the test; start fluconazole and consider EGD if symptoms do not improve after several days (in which case candidiasis may be severe, or it might not be the cause)

- **Management:** Fluconazole; nystatin is ineffective, especially in the severely immunocompromised

#### Herpes simplex esophagitis

- **Evaluation:** EGD shows diffuse ulcerations throughout the esophagus; in severe disease ulcers may coalesce into dark patches, "black esophagus." Esophageal biopsy is definitive, but can infer based on EGD appearance and serum studies.

### Management: 
Similar to other mucocutaneous infections, consider IV acyclovir at first and transition to PO once clinically improved

### CMV esophagitis/enteritis/colitis

- **Presentation:** GI bleeding (colitis) or dysphagia and odynophagia (esophagitis)
- **Evaluation:** serum CMV PCR, consult GI for consideration of EGD/colonoscopy
- **Management:** (val)ganciclovir, foscarnet if ganciclovir resistance or contraindication

### Chronic (>1 mo) intestinal isosporiasis

- **Evaluation:** Stool ova/parasite can capture Iospora belli (new name Cystoisospora belli), may need serial analysis due to intermittent shedding. Oocysts may also be seen on duodenal biopsy.
- **Management:** Bactrim; pyrimethamine + leucovorin if Bactrim is contraindicated

### Chronic intestinal cryptosporidiosis

- **Presentation:** Diarrhea; may infect respiratory tract, causing nonproductive cough
- **Evaluation:** on GiPP or Cryptosporidium Ag
- **Management:** Early initiation or optimization of ART; Monotherapy with nitazoxanide is preferred; raising CD4 count >100 is necessary to cure infection

### Recurrent Salmonella septicemia

- Generally sensitive to fluoroquinolones, but if not clinically improving as expected you can request sensitivities from the microbiology lab.

### Neoplastic

#### Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma

- DLBCL, Burkitt's, immunoblastic (subset of DLBCL), primary effusion lymphoma, and 1º CNS

#### Kaposi's sarcoma

- **Presentation:** Distinctive mucocutaneous lesions, usually raised, papular, violaceous or darkly colored, non-tender and non-pruritic. Can also involve the visceral organs (esp lungs and GI tract) and deep lymphatic system.
- **Evaluation:** clinical, tissue biopsy for staging, HHV-8 serum PCR.
- **Management:** Limited mucocutaneous disease may resolve with initiation/optimization of ART, but widespread or resistant disease may require additional local therapies (eg: radiation) or systemic chemo
- Bacillary angiomatosis (caused by Bartonella) may present similarly, but can be distinguished from KS on biopsy. It is neither a cancer nor an AIDS defining clinical condition, and is usually treated with doxycycline.

#### Cervical cancer

- Presentation, diagnosis, and treatment are essentially the same as in HIV-negative pts, but incidence is higher and disease progression is often more rapid

### Multisystem/Miscellaneous

#### Extrapulmonary or disseminated Mycobacterial infection (TB and non-TB)

- TB can go everywhere; some notable extrapulmonary sites include lymph nodes (e.g., scrofula), bones and joints (e.g., Pott's disease of the spine), pleura and pericardium, GU tract, and CNS. Dx can come from tissue culture and sometimes MTB PCR for more rapid detection (needs ID approval).

- TB-IRIS may be severe (esp with high infection burden) and hard to distinguish from TB treatment failure; can also be seen in adequately treated TB (provoked by the presence of dead bacteria) and undiagnosed latent TB.

- Disseminated MAC is usually diagnosed with AFB blood culture (only 1 positive needed). Think about it in pts with uncontrolled HIV and severe immunosuppression (esp CD4 <50), with unintentional weight loss, chronic diarrhea and/or dyspnea, and evidence of GI malabsorption or with bone marrow suppression

#### Extrapulmonary or disseminated Histoplasmosis, Cryptococcocosis, and Coccidiodomycosis

- Can be difficult to distinguish based on clinical presentation and imaging alone. Diagnosed by culture and/or antigen testing depending on the organism and site of infection, and diagnosis may be supported by serologic studies.
- Initial treatment of choice: liposomal amphotericin B in almost all cases

#### Chronic mucocutaneous HSV

- Defined as mucocutaneous lesions present for >1 month, can be present at any site

#### Multicentric Castleman's Disease

- See "Plasma Cell Dyscrasias" section in Hematology/Oncology for more details

## Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS)

**Author: Hannah Angle**

### Background:

- An inflammatory syndrome characterized by the worsening of a pre-existing infection in patients with HIV after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation
- Typically develops between 1 week to a couple months after starting ART
- Patients with lower CD4 counts and higher viral loads who respond well to ART are at higher risk of IRIS

### Evaluation:

- **IRIS is a clinical diagnosis**
  - Presentation consistent with either a systemic or localized inflammatory response (specific clinical features dependent on underlying infection)
  - Most often seen in patients with significantly decreased CD4 counts who have a profound virologic and immunologic response to ART
  - Infections most associated with IRIS include CMV, PJP, HSV, HBV, HHV-8, Cryptococcus neoformans, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)
  - Need to rule out drug-resistant infection or nonadherence to antimicrobials, bacterial superinfection, or medication adverse effect

### Management:

- Prior to ART initiation, must evaluate for all opportunistic infections (OI), especially when an inflammatory response could cause swelling in an enclosed space (cryptococcal meningitis/encephalitis, tuberculous meningitis, CMV retinitis)
  - If these serious CNS infections are identified, initiation of ART is often delayed until OI is well-controlled with antimicrobials

- IRIS is usually a self-limited syndrome as long as infection is adequately treated
  - Patients with IRIS should continue both ART and antimicrobial treatment for underlying OI
  - In severe cases, glucocorticoids can be used to decrease inflammation

## Joint Infection and Osteomyelitis

**Author: Ally Glover**

### Background:

- If high concern for septic arthritis, engage Ortho before ID. Needs arthrocentesis +/- wash out.
- ESR/CRP are helpful but nonspecific in diagnosing bone/joint infections

### Presentation

- **Septic arthritis:** erythema, effusion, limited ROM and pain with passive and active ROM
- **Osteomyelitis:** often underlying a wound (diabetic foot ulcer, sacral decubitus ulcer) but may be hematogenous as well; probe to bone positivity is diagnostic for osteomyelitis

### Evaluation

- CBC (leukocytosis), ESR, CRP
- Blood cultures
- **Imaging:** start with X-ray → if radiograph is negative for osteo, cannot rule out, need to get MRI. Very helpful if it's picked up on X-ray though due to specificity
- **Fluid studies & gram stain results from synovial fluid** if concerned for septic arthritis: usually WBC > 20,000 cells/ microL

### Management

- If pt is sick, don't wait for culture data to start empiric antibiotics
  - **Gram positives:** empiric coverage with vancomycin until ID and sensitivities; MRSA nares being negative does not rule out MRSA skin/soft tissue infection
  - **Gram negatives:** empiric coverage with ceftriaxone or cefepime if concerned for Pseudomonas.

- If concern for septic arthritis, consult Ortho, hold AC

- If a pt has a foot wound with underlying osteomyelitis, talk to Podiatry/Ortho for deep tissue biopsy. If clinically stable, hold abx.
  - IR and CT/US guided procedures don't really do bone biopsies, so talk to surgical specialty first

- **Osteomyelitis abx duration:** usually 6 weeks, but can do PO antibiotics based on susceptibilities, ID follow up

- **Septic arthritis abx duration:** usually 3-4 weeks

### Additional information:

- **Septic arthritis mimic:** gout / CPPD → obtain crystal analysis with synovial studies
- Less common causes of septic arthritis: gonococcal, Lyme disease (order serologies if suspicion is high)

## Odontogenic Infections

**Author: Ashley Zeoli**

### Background

- Consist primarily of dental caries and peridontal disease (gingivitis and periodontitis) that can have local and systemic involvement
- Streptococcus species, peptostreptococcus, Veillonella, diptheroids >80% of infections

### Presentation

- Associated w/ fever of unknown origin (fever > 3 weeks without etiology), bacteremia w/ seeding of heart valves and prosthetic devices
- Periodontal abscess commonly encountered on wards

### Evaluation

- Obtain panorex, use CT for osseous structures
- If needing additional assistance, consult OMFS

### Management

- **Pyogenic odontogenic infections:** parenteral therapy is favored
  - **Immunocompetent:** unasyn 3g IV q6 hours (alternative is PCN G with metro)
  - **Immunocompromised:** zosyn 4.5g IV q6 OR cefepime 2g IV q12 + metro 500mg PO q8

### Additional information

**Who needs antimicrobial ppx prior to dental procedures?**
- Does the pt have a high-risk condition or implanted device?
  - Yes? is the pt undergoing invasive dental procedure (manipulation of gingival tissue, periapical region of teeth, extraction, abscess drainage, routine teeth cleaning?)
    - Yes? Use antimicrobial ppx:: Amoxicillin 2g
  - No? no abx ppx needed

## Pulmonary Infections

**Authors: VASP, Evan Schwartz**

### Acute Bronchitis

#### Background

- 1-3 wks productive cough, often preceded by URI, may have wheezing/rhonchi
- Distinct from chronic bronchitis (>3 mos of consecutive cough x 2 consecutive yrs)
- Distinct from PNA (parenchymal consolidation, fever >100.4F, hypoxia, tachypnea)
- **DDx:** COVID-19, post-nasal drip, GERD, undertreated/new asthma, ACE-i induced bradykinin cough, undertreated CHF, acute PE, or new lung cancer
- Typically a clinical dx; CXR/labs not necessary unless PNA suspected

#### Management

- **Supportive:** lozenges, cough suppressants (guaifenesin or dextromethorphan), smoking cessation. Consider albuterol inhaler for wheezing
- **No indication for antibiotics**

### Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP)

See CAP algorithm (https://www.vumc.org/antimicrobial-stewardship-program/guidelines) on VASP website

#### Background

- All PNA that does not otherwise meet criteria for Hospital Acquired Pneumonia (PNA that develops ≥48 hours after hospital admission), Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (PNA that develops ≥48-72 hours after endotracheal intubation), or aspiration PNA

- Healthcare-associated pneumonia is no longer a clinical entity per 2016 IDSA guidelines

- **MRSA Risk Factors:**
  - Recent history of MRSA
  - Cavitary lesion or necrotizing pneumonia
  - Post-influenza bacterial PNA
  - Pts with IDU
  - Severe hypoxemia requiring intubation

- **Pseudomonas Risk Factors:**
  - Recent history of Pseudomonas
  - Bronchiectasis or structural lung disease

- **Both MRSA and Pseudomonas Risk Factors:**
  - Hospitalization AND IV antibiotics in previous 90 days
  - Immunocompromising conditions

- *Double coverage for Pseudomonas is not indicated in general population; LVQ has 82% sensitivity so not recommended unless isolate proven susceptible

#### Evaluation

- Sputum cultures prior to abx, consider BCx in select groups (severe pna, ICU admission, cavitary disease, immunosuppression).

- Rule out flu if the right season, COVID-19, consider RVP if it will change management

- **CURB-65 or PSI** can aid in decision between outpt vs inpt therapy
  - CURB65: Confusion, Uremia (BUN >=19mg/dL), RR (>30/min), BP(<90/60), Age ≥ 65 If ≥ 2, hospitalization is recommended.

- Consider urine pneumococcal Ag, urine Legionella Ag in severe CAP and in certain pts (e.g., neutropenia, asplenia, obstructive lung disease, hyponatremia, diarrhea, or heavy ETOH);

- CRP, ESR, and pro-calc have not been shown to reliably improve outcomes; however, pro-calcitonin < 0.25 suggests against bacterial respiratory infection and antibiotic discontinuation is encouraged

- PA/ lateral CXR. If immunocompromised, consider CT chest w/o contrast (does not improve outcomes)
  - **Lobar Consolidation** - likely bacterial
  - **Interstitial Infiltrate** - likely atypical vs. viral vs. non-infectious
  - **Cavitation** - concerning for fungal vs. necrotizing vs. mycobacterial

#### Management

- **Antibiotic Duration:** 5-7 days (at least 5 days and improvement with clinical stability)

##### Outpatient management

**Low Risk** (no chronic heart, lung, liver, renal disease, DM, alcoholism, immunocompromise)
- Amoxicillin 1g TID

**High Risk**
- Amox/clav 875/125 mg BID
- Cefuroxime 500 mg BID
- Levofloxacin 750 mg daily

##### Inpatient management

| Severity | No MRSA or Pseudomonas Risk Factors | MRSA or Pseudomonas Risk Factors |
|----------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Non-Severe/Non-ICU** | **Preferred:** Ampicillin-sulbactam 3g IV q6h OR Ceftriaxone 2g IV daily<br><br>**High Risk Penicillin AND Cephalosporin Allergy:** Levofloxacin 750mg PO (or IV) daily<br><br>If cultures are positive, target antibiotics to the recovered pathogen. | **MRSA Options:** Vancomycin (pharmacy consult) OR Linezolid 600mg PO (or IV) BID<br><br>**P. aeruginosa Options:** Cefepime 2g IV q8h or Piperacillin/tazobactam 3.375g IV q8h<br><br>*If MRSA or P. aeruginosa are not recovered on culture, change to routine CAP coverage.<br><br>If cultures are positive, target antibiotics to the recovered pathogen. |
| **Severe/ICU** | **Preferred:** Ampicillin-sulbactam 3g IV q6h OR Ceftriaxone 2g IV daily<br>**+**<br>Azithromycin 500mg IV (or PO) daily OR Doxycycline 100mg IV (or PO) q12h<br><br>**High Risk Penicillin AND Cephalosporin Allergy:** Levofloxacin 750mg IV (or PO) daily<br><br>**Addition of steroids per ICU protocol**<br><br>If RPP and Legionella urine antigen (if collected) negative, atypical coverage should be discontinued. If RPP is positive for M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae, doxycycline 100mg PO BID is preferred. If high suspicion for Legionella or positive urine antigen, azithromycin or levofloxacin are preferred over doxycycline. | **MRSA:** Vancomycin OR Linezolid (if no bacteremia)<br>**PLUS**<br>**Pseudomonas:** Cefepime 2g q8h or Pip/tazo<br>**PLUS**<br>**Atypical:** Azithromycin 500 mg IV (or PO) daily<br><br>**Addition of steroids per ICU protocol**<br><br>If RPP and Legionella urine antigen (if collected) negative, atypical coverage should be discontinued. If RPP is positive for M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae, doxycycline 100mg PO BID is preferred. If high suspicion for Legionella or positive urine antigen, azithromycin or levofloxacin are preferred over doxycycline. |

**Anaerobic Coverage:** Do NOT start metronidazole or clindamycin for aspiration pneumonia. Anaerobic coverage should be considered if empyema or lung abscess detected.

**Transition to PO** as soon as patient able to tolerate PO medications and is clinically improving. If patient has concurrent bacteremia, transition after at least 3 days of IV antibiotics.

#### Additional Information

- MRSA nasal swab has reported negative predictive value for MRSA pneumonia ranging 95% to >99%; consider sending and if negative, discontinue MRSA agent

- CTX is generally adequate coverage for aspiration PNA without evidence of abscess, empyema, or cavitary lesion on imaging

- Aspiration pneumonitis does not require abx. Rapid resolution of leukocytosis and stabilization of vitals suggest aspiration pneumonitis.

- There is low sensitivity of S. pneumoniae to azithromycin (42%) and doxycycline (72%), so these should not be used as monotherapy

- Check for drug interactions with linezolid (e.g., SSRI, methadone, methamphetamine use)

### Hospital Acquired Pneumonia (HAP) and Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP)

See HAP/VAP algorithm (https://www.vumc.org/antimicrobial-stewardship-program/guidelines) on VASP website

#### Background

- **HAP:** Pneumonia that develops >48 hours after admission
- **VAP:** Pneumonia that develops >48 hours after endotracheal intubation

#### Evaluation

- Cultures of blood, sputum, endotracheal aspirate and/or bronchoscopy specimen
- Consider MRSA nares to help with de-escalation
- If there is concern for respiratory viruses: send SARS-CoV-2/influenza/RSV (RPP may be considered for immunocompromised patients)

#### Management

- Initially cover for MRSA and Pseudomonas
- **Antibiotic Duration:** 7 days in uncomplicated cases, although specific pathogens (e.g., Pseudomonas) may require longer duration and ID guidance
- Consider ID consultation if the pt is not clinically improving on empiric therapy or if an MDR pathogen grows from culture
- If no MRSA isolated and pt is improving, consider stopping vancomycin ASAP
- There is concern for nephrotoxicity with combination Vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, but data controversial

| MRSA Coverage | Pseudomonas Coverage |
|---------------|---------------------|
| **Empiric Antibiotics:** Vancomycin (Pharmacy dosing) or linezolid | Cefepime 2g q8h OR Piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375 q8h extended infusion |

### Influenza

#### Background

- Dx often clinical w/cough, sore throat, sputum/nasal discharge, HA, fever, myalgias, and malaise; ± N/V/D. Exam with increased flushing, rarely with lower respiratory symptoms.

#### Evaluation

- During flu season: Obtain COVID/RPP or dedicated influenza PCR; testing is more accurate if obtained within 96 hour of symptom onset
- CXR if concerned for bacterial superinfection

#### Management

- Antivirals most effective when given <48 hours from symptom onset; however, recommended to be given if symptomatic despite duration and to all hospitalized pts

- **Oseltamivir** 75mg BID x 5 days, **peramivir** 600mg IV x 1 (needs renal adjustment), or **baloxavir** (age ≥12) 40mg once (use 80 mg if >80kg)

- Amantadine and rimantadine are no longer used due to emerging resistance

## Inpatient COVID-19 Management

**Author: Aisha Suara**

### Testing

- Test patients with any new fever, cough, shortness of breath, loss of taste/smell, diarrhea/vomiting, or flu-like symptoms

- Asymptomatic testing for SARS-COV-2 is no longer required for routine admissions or pre-procedures

- **Exceptions:**
  - Admission to 10 CCT, 11N, MCE6, and MCE7
  - Pre-transplant pre-procedure planning
  - May also be required by post-acute care facility prior to discharge

- Would avoid retesting those with confirmed COVID-19 within the last 30 days unless they develop symptoms or fall within the exceptions due to risk of lingering detection without contagiousness or recurrent infection

### Evaluation of Admitted Patients with Symptomatic Acute COVID-19

- Please refer to the hospital's current maximum oxygen requirement allowed on the floor to ensure patient is appropriately triaged

- **Basic admission workup for symptomatic, confirmed COVID-19**
  - **Labs:** CBC with diff, CMP, D-dimer, Ferritin, CRP, ESR, PT/INR, PTT, procalcitonin
  - **Imaging:** Portable CXR. Consider CTA PE if sudden or rapid worsening of hypoxia
  - **Nursing:** Strict I/O's to avoid pulmonary edema
  - **Enhanced precautions** (contact, airborne, eye protection)

### Management

- Fluid balance goal slightly net negative to even

- **Anticoagulation/DVT prophylaxis:**
  - Current guidelines suggest DVT ppx on admission
  - Would only initiate treatment dose anticoagulation if confirmed DVT/PE

### Pharmacologic therapies

**Note:** Therapies, indications, and contraindications are frequently changing, please see latest VUMC/VA guidelines for specific indications for these medications or others. For VUMC, REDCap form (https://redcap.vumc.org/surveys/?s=A9E7PXTCADJEA9P8) is required prior to ordering Paxlovid or Remdesivir

Course can be extending for a total of 5 days if patient progresses to severe COVID-19 (requiring supplemental oxygen)
  - **Severe COVID-19** requiring supplemental oxygen: loading dose 200mg IV x1 then 100mg daily x 4 days

- **Monitoring:** baseline CBC, INR, q48h CMP

- Do not need to remain in the hospital to complete course of Remdesivir

#### Dexamethasone

- For inpatient management of COVID-19 who require supplemental respiratory support (NC, non-invasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation, or ECMO)

- **Dosing**
  - 6mg PO/IV x 10 days; consideration of longer taper if no clinical improvement or persistently elevated CRP
  - 12mg Po/IV daily can be considered in those requiring >=10L who are clinically worsening despite 6 mg and who are not eligible for baricitinib or tocilizumab

- **Contraindications:** no hard contraindications, use clinical judgement if concomitant serious bacterial/fungal infection

#### Baricitinib (JAK inhibitor)

- Eligibility determined by ID and/or Pulm/Crit

- Use in those requiring >=6L or >40% FiO2, <=7 days since admission to the hospital, and/or clinical worsening despite steroids and supportive care

- **Contraindications:** hypersensitivity, concurrent treatment with tocilizumab, dialysis, ESRD, or acute anuric kidney injury, ALT>= 10x ULN, active TB or systemic fungal infection, or pregnancy

- **Dosing:**

- **Adverse events:** Bowel perforation, elevated lipids, elevated LFTs, serious infections

#### Antibiotics:

- Consider CAP coverage if evidence of PNA on imaging or lack of improvement despite supportive care
- Can also use procalcitonin to guide decision though procal may be elevated in severe COVID-19 infection without concomitant bacterial infection

### Discharge Recommendations

- Typical discharge criteria for respiratory illness requiring supplemental oxygen

- If patient was hospitalized FOR COVID-19, Patients should self-isolate x 20 days after the test was obtained AND until improving and fever-free x 24 hours
  - If hospitalized WITH COVID-19 (i.e. hospitalized for other indications and required remdesivir and/or steroids), would isolate for 10 days after test was obtained

- Consider telehealth PCP f/u

- May be seen in-person at clinic after they have completed the required isolation

- Consider a referral to home health

### Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Adults (MIS-A)

- Consider in those with fever with unclear etiology, history of previous COVID-19 diagnosis 2-8 weeks prior, and laboratory evidence of organ dysfunction

- See VUMC COVID-19 Guidance for MIS-A for full diagnostic criteria

- **Treatment:** IVIG, steroids, and DVT ppx

## Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MTB) and Non-tubercular mycobacterium (NTM)

**Author: Ally Glover**

### Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)

- **Micro profile:** small, aerobic, acid-fast bacillus

- **Epidemiology overview:** 8,331 reported TB cases in US in 2022 per CDC. Up to 13 million people living in the US with latent TB.

- **Terminology:** some discrepancies / evolution of language around TB
  - Active tuberculosis (now often called Tuberculosis Disease)
  - Latent TB Infection (now often called Tuberculosis Infection)

- **Transmission:** inhalation of aerosolized droplets from an infected individual

- **Possible outcomes of this exposure/transmission:**
  - Immediate clearance by host defenses
  - Primary TB Disease
  - TB infection (Latent Disease)

#### Presentations

**TB Disease (Active TB)**

- **Primary TB (after first exposure)**
  - Fever, cough, pleuritic chest pain
  - CXR: hilar/mediastinal LAD, pulmonary consolidation, pleural effusion. Some patients can present with isolated pulmonary cavitations.

- **Reactivation (post primary TB, years after exposure often)**
  - Presents more insidiously: fever, cough, malaise, weight loss, dyspnea. There is an overlap with primary TB.
  - CXR: usually involves apical and posterior upper lobe consolidations, often with cavitations

- **Extrapulmonary manifestations:** lymphadenitis, pericarditis (can cause tamponade), genitourinary (can cause infertility even in women), peritoneal involvement, and CNS involvement

**Disseminated TB**
- Also referred to as miliary TB. Can range from acute to chronic in presentation.
- Dissemination is more often seen in immunocompromised hosts (including patients with HIV/AIDS).

**TB Infection (Latent Disease)**
- Asymptomatic by definition
- The immune system has contained any active disease such that individuals are not infectious
- CXR may show old, healed tuberculosis but patient has no history of treatment. This patient would be very high risk for reactivation.

#### Testing & Diagnosis

**Who to test?**
- Clinical judgement is key
- In general, think about patients about to go on TNF-alpha blocker or a similar biologic, patients with malignancies, patients with newly diagnosed or undiagnosed HIV, patients at high risk due to living conditions (unhoused individuals in shelters, incarcerated patients).

- Tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) are often used for screening purposes
  - If someone had the BCG vaccine, cannot use TST

- If you are concerned for symptomatic TB disease, need to get 2 AFB sputum samples with Xpert testing before can come off TB precautions
  - **Xpert MTB/RIF** detects the MTB rproB gene. Also detects rifampin resistance.
    - 98% sensitive for a single sputum specimen in smear-positive culture-positive cases; approximately 70% sensitive for smear negative culture-positive cases (this increases to 90% if you test 3 samples).

#### Treatment:

**TB Infection (Latent TB):**

Different options:
- Rifampin (RIF) daily for 4 months (4R)
- Isoniazid (INH) and RIF daily for 3 months (3HR)
- INH and rifapentine (RPT) weekly for 3 months (3HP)
- INH for 6-9 months (alternative if contraindication to rifamycins)

**TB Disease:**

- Multi drug regimen for at least 6 months for pulmonary TB
  - INH, RIF, pyrazinamide (PZA), and ethambutol (EMB) for 2 months followed by INH and RIF for 4 more months

- **For CNS involvement:** 12 months of therapy plus steroids

- **For bone and joint involvement:** 6-9 months of therapy

- For certain patients with drug-susceptible TB confined to pulmonary system: new recommendation that can do a 4-month course where rifapentine (RPT) and moxifloxacin (MOX)
  - 2 months of RPT, INH, PZA, and MOX, followed by 9-weeks of RPT, INH, and MOX

- If patient has HIV, remember that TB meningitis is one of the infections most likely to result in IRIS, so ART initiation is held in this case

- These treatment summaries are for non-pregnant patients

### Non tubercular mycobacterium (NTM)

- These are mycobacteria species that do not cause tuberculosis or leprosy

- Ubiquitous in the environment

- Most well-known species: mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)

#### NTM manifestations in patients:

**Pulmonary disease**

- **Pulmonary MAC**
  - Presents usually with cough, weight loss, fatigue
  - Often occurs in patients with underlying lung disease (bronchiectasis, COPD) or patients with prior TB
  - Another common phenotype: women > 50 who are non-smokers
  - More likely to have CFTR mutations
  - Common imaging findings: nodules, bronchiectasis, and/or cavities
  - **Diagnosis:** symptoms, imaging findings, 2 positive sputum samples with NTM growth or 1+ bronchial washing (if patient symptomatic)

**Disseminated infections**
- Most often seen with HIV/AIDS
- Disseminated MAC presents usually with fever, night sweats, weight loss
- **End organ involvement:** bone marrow (manifesting as cell line derangements), adenopathy/hepatosplenomegaly, GI (manifesting as diarrhea, abdominal pain), and pulmonary
- **Diagnosis:** AFB blood cultures, culture & staining/path from end organ areas of involvement (i.e. bone marrow biopsy)

- NTM infections can also present as superficial lymphadenitis or skin infections

#### Treatment

- Depends on macrolide susceptibility

- **For pulmonary MAC:** 3 drug regimen consisting of a macrolide (usually azithromycin), a rifamycin (usually rifampin), and ethambutol.
  - Aminoglycoside also sometimes used depending on type of pulmonary disease

- Duration of treatment is usually 15-18 months. Depends on how quickly patients can clear their cultures as you need treatment until 2 consecutive sputum cultures are negative for at least 12 months

- Disseminated disease treatment is more complicated and is affected by ART often in patients with HIV, so reach out to ID
  - ART should be started in individuals with new HIV diagnosis as soon as MAC treatment is started (unless another co-infection prevents this due to risk of IRIS)

---

## Sexually Transmitted Infections

**Author: Lauren Waskowicz**

### Evaluation: Gonorrhea, Chlamydia, Trichomonas

- Microbial diagnosis is preferred, rather than clinical diagnosis alone

- **Test of choice:** NAAT of the first-catch urine in men; NAAT of vaginal swab in women

- NAAT of pharyngeal or rectal swab should also be performed in patients with reported symptoms and recent sexual exposure. Note this is also routine testing in patients on PrEP.

- Routine screening should be offered to sexually active patients, as many are asymptomatic
  - Women age < 25 years should undergo annual screening for G/C
  - MSW without HIV infection should undergo screening for G/C if at increased risk
  - MSM without HIV infection should undergo annual screening for G/C

- NAATs can detect both LGV and non-LGV chlamydia, but cannot distinguish between them

- **ALWAYS Check CDC guidelines to confirm treatment strategy given emerging resistance:** https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment-guidelines/default.htm

### Chlamydia

#### Background

- **Cause:** gram negative bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis

- Most individuals are asymptomatic though spectrum of dx: urethritis, cervicitis PID, conjunctivitis, perihepatitis (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome), pneumonia, proctitis, epididymitis, reactive arthritis, pharyngitis, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), endemic trachoma

- **Differential diagnosis:** Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium

#### Management:

- **Doxycycline** 100mg BID x 7 days
  - Alternative treatment options (for allergies/severe contraindications): azithromycin (1g PO x 1), levofloxacin (500mg PO daily x7 days), and ofloxacin (300mg BID PO x7 days)

- Pts who have receptive anal intercourse with positive rectal chlamydia NAAT should receive empiric LGV therapy with doxycycline 100mg BID for 21 days rather than 7.

- Pts with recent potential or confirmed exposure within the last 1-2 weeks should be treated empirically

- Pts with persistent symptoms, confirmed infection, and who already underwent appropriate treatment, likely have a re-infection, rather than treatment failure. Test again.

- Empiric therapy for gonorrhea should be given to pts unless NAAT is negative

- Instruct patient to abstain from sexual contact until treatment course completed, test of cure not generally warranted

- Partners should undergo screening and treatment. Expedited partner therapy (giving pt script for their partner(s)) IS legal in TN and can be used when the partner is unlikely to seek medical care.

### Gonorrhea

#### Background

- Gram-negative coccus Neisseria gonorrhoeae

- Spectrum of disease: urethritis, cervicitis, epididymitis, proctitis, pharyngeal infections, conjunctivitis, PID, and disseminated gonococcal infection

#### Management

- CTX is the only current abx that meets the strict treatment efficacy goals with single-dose therapy.
  - High dose IM ceftriaxone (<150kg 500mg IM; >150mg 1g IM)
    - Same for pharyngitis or conjunctivitis
  - CTX allergies: Azithromycin (2g PO x1) + Gentamicin (240mg IM x1) or Gemifloxacin. Would discuss with ID.

- Treatment of chlamydia must also be accompanied with gonorrhea treatment when it has not been excluded with molecular testing.
  - Doxycycline 100mg BID for 7 days

- Pts who have persistent symptoms despite tx should be suspected of having resistant gonorrhea or Mycoplasma genitalium. Test with culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (with or without NAAT).

- Partners should undergo screening and treatment. Expedited Partner Therapy is NOT legal for gonorrhea treatment in TN.

- Instruct patient to abstain from sexual contact for 7 days following treatment, test of cure not generally warranted

### Trichomonas

#### Background

- Flagellated protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis

- Most individuals are asymptomatic, although there is a spectrum of disease: urethritis or cystitis, vaginitis, cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease

- Most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection worldwide

#### Management

- **Female:** Metronidazole 500 mg BID for 7 days

- **Male:** Single dose of 2g of Metronidazole (Four 500 mg tablets)

- Due to high rates of co-infection with other STI's patients should undergo a full screening panel if Trichomonas is confirmed

- Partners should undergo screening and treatment. Expedited Partner Therapy is NOT legal for Trichomonas treatment in TN.

- Instruct patient to abstain from sexual contact until they and their sexual partner have completed treatment and are asymptomatic. Women should undergo retesting within 3 weeks to 3 months to ensure cure

### Syphilis

#### Background

- Caused by the spirochete, Treponema pallidum

- High rate of HIV co-infection among MSM with syphilis (~42%)

- Transmitted by direct contact with an infectious lesion during sex (condoms do NOT provide full protection)

- Can readily cross the placenta

#### Evaluation

- Test all pts with signs and symptoms, as well as pts who are at increased risk for acquiring infection (pts with sexual partner with early syphilis, MSM, HIV, high risk sexual behaviors, and history of commercial sex work or incarceration)

- HIV testing should be offered to all pts who test positive

- Pregnant pts should be screened for syphilis

- There are two types of serologic tests: treponemal-specific tests (FTA-ABS, MHA-TP, TPPA, TP-EIA, CIA) and nontreponemal tests (RPR, VDRL, TRUST). VUMC utilizes Reverse Sequence Algorithm due to high number of false negatives in traditional algorithm (see diagram below for testing strategy)
  - Treponemal tests typically remain positive for life following infection
  - Nontreponemal quantifies amount of antibody present and can be used to detect titers to assess for treatment. Titers should decline after a pt has been treated. A rise in titers (4 fold) in a previously treated pt should be concerning for new infection.

- Requires a humoral response, so can be false negatives if immunocompromised

- False positives: autoimmune diseases, pregnancy, other infections

- Neurosyphilis can occur at any time after infection. All newly diagnosed pts with syphilis should have a full neurologic exam and if any abnormalities should have an LP sent for CSF-VDRL (specific, but not as sensitive) with reflex to FTA-ABS (sensitive, but not as specific)

- Any pts with syphilis and vision changes should get an ophthalmology evaluation for fundoscopic exam.

#### Interpretation of Testing:

|  | +Treponemal | -Treponemal |
|---|---|---|
| **+Non-treponemal** | Diagnostic of syphilis (completely new or potentially re-infected) | Likely false positive |
| **-Non-treponemal** | Likely history of successfully treated syphilis | Likely not syphilis or false negative (due to prozone effect*) |

*Prozone effect: when there is an overabundance of antibodies and they interfere with clumping/formation of antigen/antibody complex so agglutination cannot be visualized

#### Management

- When positive Treponemal Ab + low positive or negative RPR, it is important to determine prior testing and treatment.
  - For obtaining historical syphilis titers and past treatment records, email syphilis.history@tn.gov with responses to be expected same day or next business day

- To assess treatment efficacy, goal of a fourfold decrease in titer after treatment

| Stage | Symptoms | Treatment | Treatment Alternatives |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Primary** | Painless (but can be painful) chancre at inoculation site with regional lymphadenopathy | PCN G benzathine 2.4 million units IM x1 | Doxycycline 100mg PO BID x 14 days<br>OR<br>Ceftriaxone 1-2g daily IM or IV x 10-14 days<br>OR<br>Tetracycline 500mg PO QID x 14 days<br>OR<br>Amoxicillin 3g BID and probenecid 500mg BID x 14 days |
| **Secondary** | Systemic illness with rash (palms, soles), fever, malaise, alopecia, hepatitis, mucous patches, condyloma, pharyngitis |  |  |
| **Early Latent** | Infected, but no symptoms. Occurs within one year of initial infection. |  |  |
| **Tertiary** | Symptomatic late syphilis (CV system, gummatous dx) | PCN G benzathine 2.4 million units IM weekly x3 weeks | Doxycycline 100mg PO BID x 4 weeks<br>OR<br>Ceftriaxone 2g daily IM or IV x 10-14 days |
| **Late Latent / Syphilis of Unknown Duration** | Infected, but no symptoms. Occurs >1 year after initial infection. Refer to last known negative test.<br>Date of infection unknown |  |  |
| **Neurosyphilis** | Can occur at any time.<br>**Early:** asymptomatic or symptomatic meningitis, vision loss, hearing loss<br>**Late:** brain and spinal cord manifestations (dementia, tabes dorsalis)<br>Treat ocular syphilis like neurosyphilis | Aqueous PCN G 4 million units IV q4h x 10-14 days | PCN G procaine 2.4 million units IM daily and probenecid 500mg PO QID x 10-14 days<br>If PCN allergic, desensitize<br>Ceftriaxone 2g daily IM or IV x 10-14 days |

## Skin and Soft Tissue Infection (STI)

**Author: VASP**

### Cellulitis

See SSTI algorithm on VASP website (https://www.vumc.org/antimicrobial-stewardship-program/guidelines)

#### Background

- **DDx:** erysipelas, pyomyositis, necrotizing fasciitis, osteomyelitis, venous stasis, shingles, gout

- **Pathogens:** Streptococcus species: Group A (most common), B, C, G, Staphylococcus aureus (including MSSA and MRSA)
  - Non-purulent, lymphangitis, or erysipelas? Think Streptococcus
  - Purulence (abscess or boil)? Think Staphylococcus
  - Strep anginosus is a strep species that can cause pus formation

- **Unique clinical scenarios and associated organisms/organisms to consider:**
  - Dog/cat bite: Pasteurella multicoda, Capnocytophaga canimorsus
  - Human bite: Eikenella corrodens, oral anaerobes, S. aureus
  - Fresh water exposure: Aeromonas hydropholia, Plesiomonas shigelloides
  - Salt water exposure: Vibrio vulnificus
  - Neutropenia, presence of ecthyma: Gram negatives (Pseudomonas aeruginosa)
  - Immunocompromised: Fungal (Candida spp, Cryptococcus), Nocardia, non-tubercular mycobacteria)
  - Burn pts: Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Fusarium

#### Evaluation

- Outline border of erythema and obtain urgent surgery consultation if rapid spread of infection, crepitus, air in tissues, or pain out of proportion to exam

- **Blood cultures (BCx):** ONLY needed if systemic signs of infection or immunocompromised (most pts will not need BCx or imaging)

- US for underlying abscess

- CT/MRI w/contrast: if necrotizing fasciitis, pyomyositis or osteomyelitis suspected

- **Bilateral lower extremity cellulitis is RARE** and warrants consideration of non-infectious etiologies

- **Elevation test:** if erythema improves after elevating leg above the level of the heart for 1-2 minutes, less likely to be infectious cellulitis

#### Management

- Abx for 5 days for uncomplicated; can extend to 10-14 days if little to no improvement, more extensive/serious infection, or if immunosuppressed

- Typically improvement is not seen until >48 hours of antibiotics, usually longer

- Provide anti-Staphylococcal antibiotics for purulent cellulitis in addition to I&D, if abscess present

- Clinical appearance may often appear to worsen initially despite adequate therapy

- **Always elevate the extremity for more rapid clinical improvement!**

|  | No Staph suspected | MSSA | MRSA |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mild/Moderate (Outpt)** | Cephalexin 500 QID<br>Amoxicillin 500 TID<br>Cefadroxil 1g BID | Cephalexin 500 QID<br>Cefadroxil 1g BID<br>Dicloxacillin 500 QID | *Clindamycin 300-450 mg q6h<br>TMP/SMX 1-2 DS tabs BID<br>Doxycycline 100 mg BID |
| **Severe (Inpt)** | Cefazolin 2g q8h<br>CTX 2g q24h | Cefazolin 2g q8h | Vancomycin (dose per PK)<br><br>PO step down:<br>TMP/SMX 1-2 DS tabs BID<br>Doxycycline 100 mg BID<br>Linezolid 600 mg BID<br><br>Stepdown to above PO options once:<br>• Staph aureus bacteremia is ruled out<br>• Clinical stability obtained > 24 hours<br>• Patient is tolerating oral therapy |

*Consider for PCN allergy; check antibiogram (VUMC vs VA) for Staph sensitivities; clindamycin should NOT be used for strep coverage

PO step down: cephalexin 500 mg q6h or 1000mg q8h

### Necrotizing Fasciitis

#### Background

- Infection of the deeper soft tissues that causes necrosis along the muscle fascia and overlying subcutaneous fat that is rapidly progressive and lethal if not addressed

- Clinical cues include rapid spread, pain out of proportion to exam, crepitus and hemorrhagic bullae

- LRINEC score used to screen for necrotizing soft tissue infection

#### Evaluation/Management

- **SURGICAL EMERGENCY!**
  - STAT consult to surgical service for emergent debridement (generally EGS vs ortho)
  - Imaging does NOT rule out necrotizing fasciitis and should not delay these consultations
  - CT is the best imaging modality

- ID consult

- **Empiric antibiotics**
  - **Preferred:** linezolid 600 mg IV BID + piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375g IV q8h extended infusion
  - **For severe penicillin allergy:** linezolid 600 mg IV BID + cefepime 2g IV q8h + metronidazole 500 mg IV BID
  - **For severe penicillin and cephalosporin allergy:** linezolid 600 mg IV BID + levofloxacin 750 mg IV q24h + metronidazole 500 mg IV BID
  - **If patient cannot receive linezolid** due to allergies, or multiple serotonergic drug interactions: vancomycin + piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375g IV q8h extended infusion + clindamycin 900mg IV q8h
