## Acute Pain

### Multimodal pain regimen suggestions
*Always check patient's home meds/CSMD. Restart home regimen as able*

#### Tylenol
- **Dose:** 1,000mg PO Q8H (can reduce to 650mg based on age, weight <70kg, or comorbidities)
- **Indications:** Analgesic and antipyretic
- **Contraindications:** Cirrhosis – limit to 2000mg daily

#### Gabapentin
- **Dose:** 300mg PO Q8H (reduce to 100mg, Q12H dosing, or hold based on renal function, age, or sedation level)
- **Indications:** Neuropathic pain
- **Contraindications:** ESRD
- **Side effects:** sedation, respiratory depression

#### Robaxin
- **Dose:** 500mg PO Q8H
- **Indication:** muscle relaxant
- **Contraindication:** IV formulation has preservative that is nephrotoxic

#### NSAIDs
*(check for adequate renal function and GI contraindications)*
- Toradol 15-30mg IV Q6H x 3-5 days
- Ibuprofen 600mg Q6H
- **Indications:** analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic
- **Contraindications:** CKD/AKI, ulcers, GI bleed

#### Opioids
- Oxycodone 5mg PO Q4H PRN for moderate pain, 10mg PO Q4H for severe pain
- Hydromorphone 0.5mg IV Q4H for breakthrough pain

### Thoracic epidural catheter (TEC)
- These are done and managed by the Acute Pain Service. With any issues or concerns, APS must be contacted.
- **Indications:** pain relief in thoracic dermatome distributions (rib fractures, BOLTs, etc.)
- **Contraindications:**
  - PLT <80-100, INR >1.5, coagulopathy
  - Hypotension
  - Positive blood cultures, fever, white count, etc.
- TECs remain for 5-7 days, risk of infection increases beyond that point.
- TECs run an infusion of Ropivacaine and Hydromorphone in the epidural space
- Do NOT need to d/c anticoagulation to pull TEC
  - Pt can only be on 5000 units of Subq heparin
  - Pain service can pull TEC 4hrs after last SQH dose
  - They can NOT be on the weight adjusted 7500 units
  - No Lovenox/Enoxaparin while TEC in place

## Chronic Pain

### Suboxone/Buprenorphine management
- Can restart home regimen if they have taken their suboxone in the last 48 hours
- Look at CSMD to verify their home regimen
- If re-initiation is needed, consult addiction psych
- Important for patients taking suboxone to remain on the medication
- If pain is an issue, continue their medication and consult either chronic pain or acute pain service and addiction psych
- The most effective pain medication while on Suboxone is hydromorphone, oxycodone cannot overcome the receptor affinity of Suboxone

### Methadone management
- Patients need to be evaluated by addiction psychology service for methadone recommendations while inpatient (often requires QTc monitoring)
- Patients should be continued on home regimen

## Consulting Pain Services

### Consulting Acute Pain Service (APS)
- If refractory to multimodal pain regimen above, consider consulting APS for:
  - Acute pain due to surgery in the last 7-10 days
  - Acute pain due to new trauma
- APS also provides services for patients who are receiving regional anesthetic techniques (nerve blocks, nerve catheters)

### Consulting Perioperative Consult Service
- Periop provides pain management and implements enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) for specific surgical patients on the ERAS pathway

### Consulting Chronic Pain Service (CPS)
- Service for patients with chronic pain and cancer-related pain
- If a patient is having an acute flare of a chronic problem that is not related to surgery or trauma, consult CPS
  - Examples: IBD flare, chronic pancreatitis, sickle cell pain crisis
- Consultation available Monday through Friday 7am-3pm
- The Transitional Pain Service (TPS) is a division of CPS: evaluate chronic pain patients preoperatively in clinic or before hospital discharge for outpatient pain management recommendations after surgery
